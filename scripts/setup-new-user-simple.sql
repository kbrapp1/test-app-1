-- ============================================================================
-- SETUP NEW USER SCRIPT - SIMPLE PARAMETERS
-- ============================================================================
-- This script sets up all required database entries for a new user
-- 
-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- 1. Change ONLY the 4 values in the "params" section below
-- 2. Run the entire script in Supabase SQL Editor
-- 3. Check the verification report at the end
--
-- NOTE: If users are invited via the app's invite system, this script is NOT needed.
-- The database trigger handle_new_user() now automatically creates all required entries
-- when users accept invitations and sign up. This script is only for manual user creation.
--
-- PREREQUISITES: 
-- - User must already exist in auth.users (create manually in Supabase Auth)
-- - Organization must exist in public.organizations  
-- - Role must exist in public.roles
-- ============================================================================
