Please cleanup comments in the {args} folder

1. Add, keep or revise for accuracy the head AI Instructions. It should be multiple lines
2. For subsequent comments, if they are more than 2 lines, reduce to 1-2 lines
3. Keep "Follow @golden-rule patterns - stay under 250 lines" in the main headers
4. Dont remove comments that are important such as todos, fallbacks, deprecated etc. We just want to reduce the rows of info comments
