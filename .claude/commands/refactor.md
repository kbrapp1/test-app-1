First, please read the file D:\\Projects\\test-app-1\\golden-rule.md to understand the complete DDD guidelines.

Then read and refactor {args} into smaller files following ALL the principles, patterns, and standards defined in @golden-rule.md.
- Split into smaller files following DDD, DRY, and SRP principles
- Review related code-base so you aren't creating redundancies. If existing code can be used, please do but follow @golden-rule.md as a priority
- Do not hack or put TODOs
- Pay special attention to the specific DDD layer architecture handling patterns (BusinessRuleViolationError, etc.).
- Aggregate patterns and event sourcing when needed.
- Refactored files should be 250-lines or less if possible.
- Do not over engineer!
- Proper dependency injection through composition root.
- Domain boundary respect.
- Anti-corruption layer usage.
- Remove deprecated code, files that aren't needed after the refactor
- tsc each file edited and fix any type script errors until they are all resolved
- lint check each file and fix any errors

After refactoring, summarize changes
- files changed, line counts
- what each file does
- document how the user can manually test via manual UI testing in simple terms
