# DDD-Aware Refactoring Planning Guidelines

## üéØ Code Refactoring Planning Prompt
- purpose: analyze and plan DDD-compliant refactoring before execution

```
Please analyze this code and create a practical refactoring plan following these DDD-aware rules:

ANALYSIS GOALS:
1. **Identify refactoring needs** - Files 250+ lines, mixed DDD layers, redundant code
2. **Follow DDD principles** - Respect domain, application, infrastructure, presentation boundaries
3. **Reduce line count** - Target under 250 lines through redundancy removal, not file multiplication
4. **Preserve functionality** - Ensure all existing behavior will be preserved exactly
5. **Eliminate redundancies** - Remove pass-through methods, duplicate logic, unnecessary indirection
6. **Avoid over-engineering** - Don't create new files unless absolutely necessary for DDD compliance

REFACTORING PRIORITIES (in order):
1. **Remove redundant methods** - Pass-through delegation, wrapper methods
2. **Consolidate duplicate logic** - Merge similar patterns into single implementations
3. **Extract only when necessary** - Only split files for genuine DDD layer violations
4. **Simplify, don't complicate** - Prefer removing code over creating new abstractions

DDD ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
- **Domain Analysis**: What pure business logic exists? Which aggregates are present?
- **Application Analysis**: What use cases and orchestration logic exists?
- **Infrastructure Analysis**: What external dependencies and data access patterns exist?
- **Presentation Analysis**: What UI concerns and user interaction patterns exist?
- **Security Analysis**: Where are auth variables used? What validation exists?
- **Performance Analysis**: What optimization patterns must be preserved?

PLANNING OUTPUT:
1. **Current Architecture Assessment**
   - File size and redundancy analysis
   - DDD layer boundary violations identified
   - Pass-through methods and unnecessary delegation
   - Security pattern usage documented

2. **Refactoring Recommendations** (prioritized by simplicity)
   - **Option A: Code Removal** - Remove redundant/pass-through methods (PREFERRED)
   - **Option B: Code Consolidation** - Merge duplicate logic patterns
   - **Option C: File Extraction** - Only if genuine DDD violations exist (LAST RESORT)

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Step-by-step code removal/consolidation plan
   - Testing checkpoints to verify functionality preserved
   - Risk assessment for each change

4. **Preservation Requirements**
   - Security variables that must be maintained
   - Performance patterns that must be preserved
   - Core business functionality that cannot change
   - Aggregate boundaries that cannot be broken

WHAT NOT TO PLAN:
- Don't create new files unless DDD layers are genuinely mixed
- Don't plan complex abstractions or interfaces
- Don't plan to split working, well-structured code
- Don't plan tiny extracted files
- Don't plan to change working patterns just to reduce line count
- Don't plan to remove any security variables
- Don't over-engineer solutions for simple line count issues

PLANNING DELIVERABLE:
- **Assessment Report**: Current state analysis with redundancies identified
- **Refactoring Recommendation**: Simplest approach to achieve goals (removal > consolidation > extraction)
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step code changes with testing checkpoints
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Success Criteria**: How to verify functionality preserved and goals achieved
```

- [ ] Security variables flow is preserved
- [ ] Performance patterns are maintained
- [ ] Plan targets under 250 lines through simplification
- [ ] No unnecessary file extractions planned

### **After Planning**
- [ ] Summarize the request
- [ ] Plan uses simplest approach to achieve goals
- [ ] Security requirements are fully preserved
- [ ] Performance characteristics are maintained
- [ ] Testing strategy covers all critical paths
- [ ] No over-engineering introduced
- [ ] Functionality will be identical after refactoring

## üö® Planning Red Flags

**Stop Planning If:**
- Plan requires breaking aggregate boundaries
- Security variables would be removed
- Performance optimizations would be lost
- Domain events would be eliminated
- Working, well-structured code would be split unnecessarily
- File extraction is planned instead of code removal

**Revise Plan If:**
- Creating new files when code removal would suffice
- Complex abstractions are being introduced for line count reduction
- Working patterns are being changed just to reduce lines
- Over-engineering solutions for simple redundancy issues
- Plan doesn't prioritize simplest approach first
- Testing strategy doesn't cover critical paths

**Remember: The goal is to follow DDD principles, reduce redundancy, and get under 250 lines using the SIMPLEST approach possible - usually code removal, not file creation.**
