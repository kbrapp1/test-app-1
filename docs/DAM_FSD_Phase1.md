# Functional Specification Document: Digital Asset Management (DAM) - Phase 1

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional requirements for the initial phase of the Digital Asset Management (DAM) system within the `my-v0-project` application. The goal is to provide a simple way to upload, view, and manage digital assets (initially focusing on images). **A key objective is to deliver a modern, highly interactive, and performant user experience ('FANG-like' quality) from the outset.**

## 2. Goals

*   Allow users to upload image files via intuitive interactions.
*   Store uploaded images securely using Supabase Storage.
*   Display uploaded images in a responsive and visually appealing gallery view.
*   Allow users to delete uploaded images with clear feedback and smooth UI updates.
*   **Achieve a high standard of User Experience (UX) characterized by responsiveness, smooth transitions, and intuitive design.**
*   Provide a foundation for future DAM enhancements (tagging, searching, folders, etc.).

## 3. User Roles

*   **User:** Any authenticated user of the application. (For Phase 1, we might not implement strict authorization, assuming any logged-in user can manage assets).

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Asset Upload

*   **FR-DAM-001:** The system shall provide an intuitive interface, **including a clear button and a drag-and-drop area**, for users to select one or more image files from their local device.
*   **FR-DAM-002:** The system shall restrict uploads to specific image file types (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP). Configurable list. **Client-side validation should provide immediate feedback.**
*   **FR-DAM-003:** The system shall display **real-time upload progress** for each file (visual indicator, e.g., progress bar).
*   **FR-DAM-004:** Upon successful upload, the image shall be stored in a designated Supabase Storage bucket.
*   **FR-DAM-005:** The system shall record basic metadata for each uploaded asset in a Supabase database table (e.g., filename, file size, file type, Supabase storage path, uploader user ID, upload timestamp).
*   **FR-DAM-006:** The system shall provide **clear, non-intrusive user feedback** upon successful upload or failure (e.g., toast notification, update in UI state).

### 4.2. Asset Listing (Gallery View)

*   **FR-DAM-007:** The system shall display all uploaded images accessible to the user in a **responsive gallery format** (e.g., a grid of thumbnails adapting to screen size).
*   **FR-DAM-008:** Each image in the gallery shall display its thumbnail. Clicking the thumbnail should **smoothly transition** to show a larger preview (e.g., using a modal or an inline expansion).
*   **FR-DAM-009:** The gallery shall fetch asset information (thumbnails, metadata) efficiently from the Supabase database and storage.
*   **FR-DAM-010:** **Efficient loading strategies** (e.g., pagination, infinite scroll, or virtualization) should be implemented to handle a large number of assets gracefully.

### 4.3. Asset Deletion

*   **FR-DAM-011:** Users shall be able to easily select an image from the gallery view for deletion (e.g., hover effect with delete icon).
*   **FR-DAM-012:** The system shall prompt the user for confirmation before deleting an asset using a standard, non-blocking dialog.
*   **FR-DAM-013:** Upon confirmation, the system shall delete the corresponding image file from Supabase Storage.
*   **FR-DAM-014:** Upon confirmation, the system shall delete the corresponding metadata record from the Supabase database table.
*   **FR-DAM-015:** The gallery view shall update **immediately and smoothly** to reflect the deletion, ideally without a full page reload (e.g., using optimistic UI updates or efficient revalidation).
*   **FR-DAM-016:** The system shall provide clear user feedback upon successful deletion or failure.

## 5. User Interface (UI) Components (High-Level)

*   **Upload Component:** Handles file selection (button & drag-and-drop), displays **real-time progress per file**, initiates upload. Should feel responsive.
*   **Asset Gallery Component:** Displays assets in a responsive grid, handles **efficient loading**, supports smooth interactions for previewing/selecting assets.
*   **Asset Thumbnail Component:** Represents a single asset, shows relevant info on hover/focus, includes intuitive delete trigger, participates in smooth gallery updates.
*   **Confirmation Dialog:** Standard modal for confirming deletions, consistent with `shadcn/ui` style.
*   **Notifications:** Toast messages or similar for success/error feedback, consistent and unobtrusive.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-DAM-001:** Uploads should be performant, with **minimal UI blocking** and clear progress indication.
*   **NFR-DAM-002:** Asset retrieval and gallery rendering should be **highly efficient and feel instantaneous** to the user.
*   **NFR-DAM-003:** Storage costs should be considered (potential limits on file size or total storage per user in later phases).
*   **NFR-DAM-004:** All interactions (drag-drop, clicks, previews, deletions) should feel **smooth and responsive**, with appropriate visual feedback (e.g., transitions, loading states).

## 7. Future Enhancements

Beyond the scope of Phase 1, several enhancements are planned to build a more robust DAM system. 

A detailed potential roadmap outlining these features in logical phases can be found in the dedicated document: [DAM Feature Roadmap](./DAM_Roadmap.md).

## 8. Assumptions

*   Users are already authenticated via the existing Supabase auth setup.
*   Basic Supabase project setup (database, storage) is complete or will be done as part of implementation.
*   Styling will use the existing Tailwind CSS setup and `shadcn/ui` components.
