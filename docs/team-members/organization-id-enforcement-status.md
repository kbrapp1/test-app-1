# Teams Feature - Organization ID Enforcement Status

This document tracks the implementation of organization ID enforcement for the teams feature to ensure proper multi-tenant data isolation.

## Current Status: ❌ PARTIALLY COMPLETE (60%)
**Risk Level**: ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK - Missing application layer enforcement

---

## Implementation Assessment

### ✅ Database Layer - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] **`teams` table has `organization_id UUID NOT NULL`** with FK constraint to `organizations(id)`
- [x] **`team_members` table has `organization_id UUID NOT NULL`** with FK constraint to `organizations(id)`  
- [x] **RLS policies enforce organization context**:
  - Teams: `"Org members can interact with teams in their org"` - Uses organization membership check
  - Team_members: `"Team Member RLS Policy"` - Uses organization membership check with admin-only write access
- [x] **Unique constraints per-organization** (team names unique within org)
- [x] **No orphaned data possible** due to proper constraints
- [x] **Super admin override policies** in place

### ❌ TypeScript Types - CRITICAL GAP
- [ ] **`TeamMember` interface missing `organization_id` field**
- [ ] **Type definitions don't reflect database schema**
- [ ] **Potential for type/runtime mismatches**

**Current Interface:**
```typescript
// types/team.ts - MISSING organization_id
export interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  title: string;
  // organization_id: string; ← MISSING THIS CRITICAL FIELD
  primary_image_url: string;
  secondary_image_url: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### ❌ Server Actions - MISSING EXPLICIT CONTEXT
- [x] **Permission checks implemented** (`checkCreateTeamMemberAccess`, etc.)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Server actions don't explicitly set `organization_id` when inserting
- [ ] **RISK**: Relies only on RLS policies for organization isolation
- [ ] **MISSING**: No explicit organization context validation in business logic

**Current Implementation Issues:**
```typescript
// lib/auth/actions/team.ts - MISSING explicit organization_id
const { data: insertData, error: insertError } = await supabase
  .from('team_members')
  .insert({
    name,
    title,
    // organization_id: await getActiveOrganizationId(), ← MISSING THIS
    primary_image_path,
    secondary_image_path,
  })
```

### ✅ Application Layer - PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] **Team page protected** with permission checks (`checkTeamAccess`)
- [x] **Client components use permission hooks** (`useTeamPermissions`, `useTeamMemberPermissions`)
- [x] **Organization context properly managed** in UI layer
- [x] **Feature flag integration** working correctly

## Security Risk Analysis

### Current Risks:
1. **Missing Explicit Organization Context**: Server actions rely solely on RLS policies
2. **Type Safety Gap**: TypeScript types don't match database schema
3. **Potential for Cross-Organization Access**: If RLS policies fail, no application-layer protection

### Current Protections:
1. **Database-Level Security**: RLS policies prevent cross-organization access
2. **Permission System**: Feature access properly controlled
3. **UI Layer Protection**: Components respect organization context

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Immediate Risk**: LOW (RLS policies provide strong protection)
- **Long-term Risk**: MEDIUM (missing defense-in-depth)

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix TypeScript Types
```typescript
// types/team.ts - ADD organization_id
export interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  title: string;
  organization_id: string; // ← ADD THIS FIELD
  primary_image_url: string;
  secondary_image_url: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### Priority 2: Add Explicit Organization Context to Server Actions
```typescript
// lib/auth/actions/team.ts - ADD explicit organization_id

// Import organization context helper
import { getActiveOrganizationId } from '@/lib/auth/server/getActiveOrganizationId';

// In addTeamMember function:
const { data: insertData, error: insertError } = await supabase
  .from('team_members')
  .insert({
    name,
    title,
    organization_id: await getActiveOrganizationId(), // ← ADD THIS
    primary_image_path,
    secondary_image_path,
  })

// In updateTeamMember function:
const { data: updateData, error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('team_members')
  .update({
    name,
    title,
    organization_id: await getActiveOrganizationId(), // ← ADD THIS
    // ... other fields
  })
  .eq('id', id)
  .eq('organization_id', await getActiveOrganizationId()) // ← AND THIS
```

### Priority 3: Add Organization Context Validation
```typescript
// Add explicit validation in business logic
async function validateOrganizationContext(teamMemberId: string): Promise<void> {
  const activeOrgId = await getActiveOrganizationId();
  const { data: teamMember } = await supabase
    .from('team_members')
    .select('organization_id')
    .eq('id', teamMemberId)
    .single();
    
  if (teamMember?.organization_id !== activeOrgId) {
    throw new Error('Team member not found in current organization');
  }
}
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Database Layer: ✅ Complete (4/4)
- [x] `organization_id` column with NOT NULL constraint
- [x] Foreign key constraint to `organizations(id)` with CASCADE DELETE
- [x] RLS policies enforce organization context
- [x] Unique constraints per-organization

### TypeScript Types: ❌ Incomplete (0/2)
- [ ] `TeamMember` interface includes `organization_id` field
- [ ] Type definitions match database schema

### Server Actions: ❌ Incomplete (1/3)
- [x] Permission checks implemented
- [ ] Explicit organization context in mutations
- [ ] Organization validation in business logic

### Application Layer: ✅ Complete (3/3)
- [x] Page-level permission protection
- [x] Component-level permission hooks
- [x] Organization context management

**Overall Progress: 8/12 (67%)**

## Testing Requirements

After implementing fixes, verify:

1. **Cross-Organization Access Prevention**:
   - User from Org A cannot see/modify team members from Org B
   - Team member creation properly sets organization context
   - Team member updates validate organization ownership

2. **Type Safety**:
   - TypeScript compilation succeeds with organization_id in types
   - No runtime type mismatches

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Proper error messages when organization context is missing
   - Graceful handling of organization validation failures

---

## Completion Timeline

- **Immediate (< 1 hour)**: Fix TypeScript types
- **High Priority (< 4 hours)**: Add explicit organization context to server actions
- **Medium Priority (< 8 hours)**: Add organization validation to business logic
- **Testing (< 2 hours)**: Verify cross-organization access prevention

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-15 hours

## Notes for Future Features

When implementing organization ID enforcement for new features, ensure:

1. **Database**: Add `organization_id UUID NOT NULL` with FK constraint
2. **RLS**: Create policies using `get_active_organization_id()` or membership checks
3. **Types**: Include `organization_id` in all TypeScript interfaces
4. **Server Actions**: Explicitly set organization context in all mutations
5. **Application**: Add organization validation in business logic
6. **Permissions**: Integrate with permission system
7. **Testing**: Verify no cross-organization access possible

This teams feature implementation should serve as a template for completing organization ID enforcement across all other features (DAM, chatbot-widget, etc.).
