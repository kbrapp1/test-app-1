# Monitoring Module Audit Task List

A step-by-step checklist to address issues uncovered in the `lib/monitoring` audit.

## 🚨 Critical Violations (Priority 1 – Must fix before next release)
- [x] Fix presentation hook layer-boundary breach in `usePerformanceTracking.ts`: use `PerformanceTrackingState` DTO instead of importing domain entities directly.
- [x] Remove `window` usage from `ReactQueryCallAnalyzer` (infrastructure) and refactor to accept context via parameters.
- [x] Split `ReportGenerationService.ts` (263 lines) into smaller, single-responsibility classes or services.
- [x] Review and document cross-domain imports in `CrossDomainReportGenerationService.ts`; confirm intentional domain boundaries.

## 🔥 High-Impact Performance Issues (Priority 2 – Address in next sprint)
- [x] Optimize string-building in `ReportGenerationService.generateFromNetworkIssues` (consider template literals or streaming output).
- [x] Memoize regex patterns in `ReactQueryCallAnalyzer.identifyAllCacheRelatedCalls` to reduce repeated pattern compilation.
- [x] Throttle or debounce Web Vitals event handlers in `usePerformanceTracking` to avoid excessive re-renders.
- [x] Add exponential back-off or adaptive intervals to polling in `NetworkMonitoringService`.

## ⚠️ Code Quality Issues (Priority 3 – Plan for next 1-2 sprints)
- [x] Refactor large application and infrastructure files (>250 lines) by extracting distinct concerns into their own modules.
- [x] Consolidate duplicated header/footer generation logic into a single `ReportTemplateService` or shared utility.
- [x] Add error logging to suppressed exceptions in `ReactQueryCallAnalyzer.detectPaginationParameters`.
- [x] Enforce Single Responsibility and DRY principles by removing code duplication across services.

## ⚡ Optimization Opportunities (Priority 4 – Backlog as future improvements)
- [x] Lazy-load heavy modules (e.g., `ReactQueryCallAnalyzer`, `NetworkMonitoringService`) via dynamic imports.
- [x] Use `React.memo` and `useMemo` for expensive hooks and components within the presentation layer.
- [x] Implement cache warm-up strategies for frequently accessed performance metrics.
- [x] Explore bundle splitting for monitoring infrastructure code to reduce initial load.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Review (Bonus)
- [n] Add schema validation (e.g., Zod) for performance DTO inputs to guard against invalid data.
- [n] Remove hard-coded endpoints or secrets; leverage environment variables for configuration.
- [n] Ensure encryption at rest and in transit for any stored performance data.
- [n] Review cross-domain report templates for potential PII exposure and GDPR compliance.

## ♿ Accessibility Check (Bonus)
- [n] Audit monitoring UI components for proper ARIA roles and semantic HTML.
- [n] Verify keyboard navigation and focus management across interactive elements.
- [n] Ensure color contrast and font sizes meet WCAG AA guidelines.
