# Invite URL Fix Summary

## Problem
When inviting users from the organization settings page, the invitation emails were always using the Vercel production URL (`https://test-app-1-beta.vercel.app/login`) regardless of whether the invite was sent from localhost or the production environment. This caused:

1. Invites sent from localhost to redirect to the Vercel production site
2. Users clicking "Accept Invite" to go to the wrong environment
3. Broken onboarding flow due to environment mismatch

## Root Cause
The issue was in the URL determination logic in `lib/actions/members.ts`. The original logic was:

```typescript
const appUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
               ? (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL_DEV || 'http://localhost:3000') 
               : (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL);
```

The problem was that `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` was set to `http://localhost:3000` in the environment variables, which was incorrect for production deployments.

## Solution
Updated the URL determination logic to properly handle different environments:

### 1. Fixed `lib/actions/members.ts`
```typescript
// Determine the correct application URL based on the environment
let appUrl: string;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // Development environment - use localhost
  appUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL_DEV || 'http://localhost:3000';
} else {
  // Production environment - use Vercel environment variables
  const vercelUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL;
  if (vercelUrl) {
    appUrl = `https://${vercelUrl}`;
  } else {
    // Final fallback for non-Vercel deployments
    appUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'https://test-app-1-beta.vercel.app';
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Edge Functions
- **`supabase/functions/invite-member/index.ts`**: Updated fallback URL from `http://localhost:3000` to `https://test-app-1-beta.vercel.app`
- **`supabase/functions/admin-resend-invitation/index.ts`**: Added better logging and fallback handling

### 3. Environment Variable Usage
The new logic uses this hierarchy:

**Development:**
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL_DEV` (if set)
2. `http://localhost:3000` (fallback)

**Production:**
1. `VERCEL_URL` (automatically provided by Vercel)
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (if set)
3. `https://test-app-1-beta.vercel.app` (final fallback)

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/actions/members.ts` - Fixed URL determination logic
2. `supabase/functions/invite-member/index.ts` - Updated fallback URL
3. `supabase/functions/admin-resend-invitation/index.ts` - Improved URL handling
4. `lib/actions/members.test.ts` - Added tests for URL determination logic

### Benefits:
- ✅ Invites from localhost now correctly redirect to localhost
- ✅ Invites from production now correctly redirect to production
- ✅ Proper environment context is maintained throughout the invite flow
- ✅ Onboarding experience works correctly in both environments
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms ensure the system works even with missing environment variables

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests in `lib/actions/members.test.ts` to verify:
- Development environment uses localhost
- Production environment uses VERCEL_URL when available
- Fallback to NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL when VERCEL_URL is not available
- Final fallback to hardcoded production URL
- Development takes precedence even when production variables are set

## Environment Variables
No changes needed to existing environment variables. The fix works with the current setup:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000` (can remain as is)
- `VERCEL_URL` is automatically provided by Vercel in production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL_DEV` can be optionally set for custom development URLs

## Deployment
The fix is backward compatible and doesn't require any environment variable changes. It will work immediately upon deployment to both development and production environments.
