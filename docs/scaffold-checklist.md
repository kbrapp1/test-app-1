# Scaffold Completion Checklist

This document outlines the recommended steps and features to consider this scaffold project "complete" and ready for cloning as a robust starting point for new applications. It focuses on establishing common patterns, providing essential building blocks, and ensuring a good developer experience.

**Goal:** Create a reusable, well-structured starting point for full-stack Next.js/Supabase applications.

**Key Principles:**

*   Focus on **patterns** and **structure**, not deep feature implementation.
*   Provide **reusable components** and **examples**.
*   Ensure **good developer experience** (testing, linting, docs).
