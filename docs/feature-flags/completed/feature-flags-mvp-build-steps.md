# Feature Entitlement System - MVP Build Steps

**STATUS:** MVP COMPLETE ✅

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURE GOALS:**
- ✅ **DDD Compliance:** Aligned with existing DDD patterns for `Organization` and `User` contexts.
- ✅ **Single Responsibility:** Ensured new components (hooks, services) have a single, clear purpose.
- ✅ **Scalable Pattern:** Established a reusable pattern that can be applied to any feature.

**MVP SUMMARY:**
The core Feature Entitlement MVP is complete. The system allows enabling/disabling features on a per-organization basis, establishing a secure, scalable foundation for creating distinct product tiers and managing feature rollouts. The **Text-to-Speech** feature was used as the pilot.

**Reference Architecture:**
- ✅ **Domain Layer:** The `Organization` entity was updated to own the feature flags.
- ✅ **Infrastructure Layer:** Supabase persistence for feature flags is live.
- ✅ **Application Layer:** Flags are now available to the app via a new application service.
- ✅ **Presentation Layer:** A reusable `useFeatureFlag` hook was created for checking flags in the UI.

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- ✅ **Security First:** All feature gates are enforced on the backend (server actions) in addition to the UI.
- ✅ **Default Off:** The system is designed so that if a flag is not explicitly present, the feature is disabled.
- ✅ **DDD Compliance:** Followed existing domain patterns for the `Organization` bounded context.

## Completed MVP Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Database Schema** ✅
- [x] **File:** `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_feature_flags_to_orgs.sql`
- [x] **Action:** A migration was created and applied to add the `feature_flags` JSONB column to the `organizations` table.

**Step 2: Domain & Infrastructure Layers - The Data Foundation** ✅
- [x] **File:** `lib/auth/services/organization-service.ts`
- [x] **Action:** Enhanced `Organization` interface with `feature_flags: Record<string, boolean>;`.
- [x] **File:** `lib/organization/application/services/getActiveOrganizationWithFlags.ts`
- [x] **Action:** Created a new application service to fetch the active organization with its flags, ensuring the backend query includes the new `feature_flags` column.

**Step 3: Application & Presentation Layers - Consuming the Flags** ✅
- [x] **File:** `lib/organization/application/hooks/useOrganizationContext.ts`
- [x] **Action:** Ensured the main organization context provider makes the flags available to the frontend.
- [x] **File:** `lib/organization/presentation/hooks/useFeatureFlag.ts`
- [x] **Action:** Created the `useFeatureFlag` hook for clean, reusable checks.

**Step 4: Pilot Integration: Gating the "Text-to-Speech" (TTS) Feature** ✅
- [x] **File:** `components/nav-main.tsx`
- [x] **Action 4.1: Protected the Navigation Link (UI)**
  - [x] Imported and used the `useFeatureFlag` hook to conditionally render the navigation item.
- [x] **File:** `app/(protected)/ai-playground/text-to-speech/page.tsx`
- [x] **Action 4.2: Protected the Page Route (UI)**
  - [x] Used the hook to check the `tts` flag and render a "Feature Not Enabled" component if false.
- [x] **File:** `lib/actions/tts.ts`
- [x] **Action 4.3: Protected the Backend Actions (Security)**
  - [x] Added a check at the beginning of all TTS server actions. If `feature_flags.tts` is not `true`, an authorization error is thrown. This is the critical security backstop.

## Next Steps

### Step 5: End-to-End Testing
- [x] **Action 5.1: Manual E2E Testing**
  - [x] **Scenario 1 (Flag Enabled):**
    - [x] Using a test organization, set `feature_flags` in the database to `{"tts": true}`.
    - [x] Log in as a user from that organization.
    - [x] **Verify:** The TTS link is visible in the navigation.
    - [x] **Verify:** The TTS page loads and functions correctly.
  - [x] **Scenario 2 (Flag Disabled):**
    - [x] Using a different test organization, set `feature_flags` to `{}` or `{"tts": false}`.
    - [x] Log in as a user from that organization.
    - [x] **Verify:** The TTS link is NOT visible in the navigation.
    - [x] **Verify:** Attempting to navigate directly to the `/ai-playground/text-to-speech` URL shows the "Feature Not Enabled" message.
    - [x] **Verify:** Any attempt to call the TTS generation action fails with an error.

### Step 6: Future Work (Post-MVP)
- [x] **Rollout:** Apply the feature flag pattern to other key features (DAM, Reporting, etc.) as needed.
- [x] **Administration UI:** Build a UI in the Super Admin panel to allow for easy toggling of feature flags for any organization, removing the need for direct database edits.
- [x] **Refactor:** Promote the `Organization` interface from `lib/auth/services/organization-service.ts` to a proper domain entity class at `lib/organization/domain/entities/Organization.ts` to fully align with DDD.
