# Feature Entitlement System: Product Requirements

This document outlines the product goals, user stories, and functional requirements for a system that manages feature access for different organizations.

## 1. Problem Statement

The platform currently provides the same set of features to all users, regardless of their organization. To support diverse customer needs and enable commercial growth, we need a mechanism to offer different tiers of functionality. This will allow for flexible pricing strategies, enterprise-specific features, and controlled rollouts of new tools (e.g., beta programs).

## 2. High-Level Goals

The primary objectives of this system are:

-   **Enable Product Tiering:** To create distinct product offerings (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise) with different sets of features.
-   **Per-Organization Entitlement:** To enable or disable specific feature modules (like DAM, TTS, Reporting, etc.) for individual client organizations.
-   **Clean User Experience:** To ensure the user interface is uncluttered and only displays the features and actions that are actually available to the user.
-   **Secure Access Control:** To implement a robust and secure system that prevents unauthorized access to features and data at both the UI and API levels.
-   **Support Controlled Rollouts:** To allow new features to be released to a select group of beta-testing organizations for feedback before a general release.

## 3. User Stories

### Persona: Client Administrator (e.g., 'admin' at Acme Corp)
-   **Story:** As a Client Administrator, I want to see only the features that my organization has subscribed to, so my team's workspace is not cluttered with inaccessible tools and I can train my team effectively.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   Navigation menus (e.g., sidebars, headers) do not show links to features the organization is not entitled to.
    -   Attempting to access a URL for a disabled feature results in a clear "Feature Not Available" page, not a generic error.

### Persona: Product Manager
-   **Story:** As a Product Manager, I want to be able to enable a new "Reporting" feature for a select group of beta-testing organizations.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   There is a mechanism (e.g., via a super-admin panel or a database script) to modify an organization's feature entitlements.
    -   The change takes effect for users of that organization upon their next session or page load.
    -   The feature can be enabled without requiring a new code deployment.

### Persona: Developer
-   **Story:** As a Developer, I need a simple, consistent, and secure pattern for checking if a feature is enabled, so I can reliably show/hide UI elements and protect backend endpoints without re-inventing the wheel for each feature.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   A reusable hook (e.g., `useFeatureFlag()`) is available on the frontend for checking entitlements.
    -   A clear pattern exists for protecting server actions and API routes based on feature flags.
    -   The system is documented with code examples.

### Persona: End User (e.g., 'member' at a client org)
-   **Story:** As an End User, I want to be confident that the buttons and links I see are ones I'm actually allowed to use, to avoid the frustration of clicking on something only to be told I don't have permission.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   Action buttons (e.g., "Upload Asset", "Create Report") are disabled or hidden if the user's role does not permit that action.
    -   The UI feels intuitive and does not present dead ends.
