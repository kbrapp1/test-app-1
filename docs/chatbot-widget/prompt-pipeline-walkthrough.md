**Dynamic Prompt Injection**: Context-aware prompting reduces token usage by 70-85%
**Intent Progression Tracking**: Understands conversation flow and business context evolution
**Conversation Memory**: Maintains business context across sessions with intelligent summarization

---

## ðŸ§  Intelligent Prompt Engineering Pipeline

### Phase 1: Context-Aware Prompt Construction

#### Dynamic System Prompt Building
The system dynamically constructs prompts based on conversation context, not static templates:

**Base Prompt Components:**
- **Core Persona**: ChatBot identity, business context, communication style
- **Intent Classification Instructions**: 20 predefined business intent categories
- **Entity Extraction Guidelines**: Smart selection of relevant entities to extract
- **Conversation Context**: Injected based on session history and business context established
- **Response Generation Rules**: Tone, call-to-action logic, personalization instructions

#### Smart Context Injection Strategy with Aging Logic

**Knowledge Base Injection (Conditional with Business Context Strength)**:

Our system uses **intelligent context decay** to determine injection levels:

```typescript
// Business context strength decays 15% per turn after establishment
static getBusinessContextStrength(sessionContext: SessionContext): number {
  const turnsSince = this.getTurnsSinceLastBusiness(intentHistory);
  const businessIntentCount = this.getBusinessIntentCount(intentHistory);
  
  // Decay strength over time but maintain baseline for multiple business intents
  let strength = Math.max(0.3, 1.0 - (turnsSince * 0.15));
  
  // Boost for multiple business interactions (+20%)
  if (businessIntentCount >= 2) {
    strength = Math.min(1.0, strength + 0.2);
  }
  
  return strength; // 0.0 to 1.0 scale
}
```

**Context Injection Rules Based on Strength**:
- **Strong Business Context** (0.8-1.0 strength): 90-95% knowledge injection
- **Medium Business Context** (0.5-0.79 strength): 60-70% selective injection  
- **Weak Business Context** (0.3-0.49 strength): 20-30% minimal injection
- **Expired Business Context** (<0.3 strength): No business knowledge injection

**Entity Context Injection with Age Indicators**:
When entities are discovered and stored, they get injected with **age-aware context**:
```typescript
// Entities show age to indicate freshness
if (entities.budget) {
  const age = this.getEntityAge(entities.budget.extractedAt);
  contextParts.push(`Budget mentioned: ${entities.budget.value} (${age})`);
}
// Output: "Budget mentioned: $200K (2h ago)" or "Budget mentioned: $200K (just now)"
```

**Entity Age Categories in Prompts**:
- **Fresh** (0-30 minutes): Full confidence, highest priority injection
- **Recent** (30 minutes - 4 hours): High confidence with age indicator
- **Aging** (4-24 hours): Medium confidence, "X hours ago" displayed
- **Stale** (24+ hours): Lower confidence, requires re-validation

**Intent History Injection (Session-Based)**:
Tracks conversation progression and business context establishment:
- Business context established: Yes/No flag
- Product interest signals: Feature discussions, pricing inquiries
- Qualification progression: Budget mentioned, timeline discussed, decision authority indicated
- Conversation sentiment: Positive engagement, objection handling, closing signals

### Phase 2: Intelligent Entity Extraction (2025 Approach)

#### Selective Entity Extraction Strategy

**The Problem We Solved**: Traditional systems waste tokens extracting ALL entities on EVERY message.

**Our Solution**: Dynamic entity schema that only extracts missing or contextually relevant entities.

#### Progressive Entity Discovery

**Initial Conversation (Messages 1-2)**:
Focus on: Company, role, basic industry context, initial intent signals

**Discovery Phase (Messages 3-5)**:
Add: Team size, pain points, current solutions, budget signals

**Qualification Phase (Messages 6+)**:
Add: Timeline, decision makers, specific requirements, urgency levels

**Correction Detection (All phases)**:
Special handling for: "Actually, our budget is $200K" or "Jane is no longer the decision maker"

#### Entity Weighting, Confidence, and Correction Handling

**Confidence Scoring (0.0-1.0)**:
- High confidence (0.8-1.0): Direct statements, specific details
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.79): Implied information, context clues
- Low confidence (0.3-0.49): Uncertain extractions, ambiguous statements

**Entity Correction Priority System**:
Our system handles entity updates with sophisticated priority rules:

1. **Explicit Corrections** (highest priority): "Actually, our budget is $500K"
2. **Contextual Updates** (medium priority): New information that contradicts old
3. **Confidence-Based Replacement** (low priority): Higher confidence overwrites lower
4. **Time-Based Deprecation** (automatic): Old entities fade in favor of recent ones

**Entity Persistence Strategy by Type**:
- **Critical Entities** (company, contact info): Persist until explicitly corrected
- **Fluid Entities** (budget, timeline): Update with latest information
- **Accumulative Entities** (pain points, decision makers): Add to list, don't replace
- **Temporary Entities** (urgency, current topic): Expire after conversation context changes

**Array Entity Management**:
- **Decision Makers**: Accumulates multiple stakeholders with roles
- **Pain Points**: Builds comprehensive challenge list
- **Integration Needs**: Technical requirements discovery
- **Competitive Mentions**: Tracks evaluation process

### Phase 3: Conversation Memory and Context Management

#### Session Context Persistence

**What Gets Stored in Database**:
- **Accumulated Entities**: All discovered business facts with confidence scores
- **Intent History**: Sequence of conversation intents and business context flags
- **Conversation Summary**: AI-generated summary when conversations exceed 10 turns
- **Lead Qualification State**: Scoring evolution and qualification status
- **Response Metadata**: Tone preferences, communication style, engagement patterns

#### Multi-Turn Conversation Intelligence

**Turn 1**: "Hi, what are your pricing plans?"
- Intent: faq_pricing
- Entities: None extracted
- Context: New conversation, basic response

**Turn 2**: "We're a 50-person company looking to spend around $200K by Q2"
- Intent: qualification (progression detected)
- Entities: teamSize: "50", budget: "$200K", timeline: "Q2"
- Context: Enhanced prompt includes previous intent, qualification signals detected
- Response: More detailed, enterprise-focused, demo offer included

**Turn 3**: "How does this compare to Salesforce?"
- Intent: competitive_analysis
- Entities: currentSolution: "Salesforce" (competitor detected)
- Context: Full conversation history, competitive positioning response
- Response: Feature comparison, differentiation points, ROI analysis

#### Context Window Management with Aging Logic

**Token Budget Management with 2025 Optimization**:
- Total budget: 16,000 tokens (2025 enhanced limit)
- System prompt allocation: 800 tokens (enhanced business context)
- Conversation history: 6,000-8,000 tokens (18 turns vs 10)
- Response generation: 3,500 tokens reserved (detailed responses)
- Summary allocation: 300 tokens (enhanced compression)
- Buffer: 1,000 tokens for safety

**Intelligent Context Aging for Token Efficiency (2025 Enhanced)**:
- **Recent Messages** (last 8 turns): Full context preserved (100% injection)
- **Older Messages** (9-15 turns): Summarized context (70% injection with age indicators)
- **Ancient Messages** (16-18 turns): Entity extraction + summary (40% injection)
- **Context Overflow**: Automatic summarization when approaching token limits (0% injection for expired context)

**Session Expiration and Cleanup Rules**:
```typescript
// Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity (Domain Service Pattern)
isExpired(timeoutMinutes: number = 30): boolean {
  ChatSessionValidationService.validateTimeout(timeoutMinutes);
  
  // AI INSTRUCTIONS: Delegate to domain service following @golden-rule patterns
  // Domain logic: Session expires when lastActivityAt exceeds timeout threshold
  const timeoutMs = timeoutMinutes * 60 * 1000;
  const now = new Date().getTime();
  return now - this.props.lastActivityAt.getTime() > timeoutMs;
}
```

**Session Lifecycle States**:
- **Active** (0-30 minutes): Full conversation context maintained
- **Idle** (30-60 minutes): Context preserved but flagged for potential cleanup
- **Expired** (60+ minutes): Session marked as abandoned, context archived
- **Abandoned** (24+ hours): Eligible for cleanup, summary preserved

**Conversation Summarization Triggers**:
- **Message Count**: >10 messages triggers summarization
- **Token Threshold**: Context approaching 8,000 tokens
- **Time-Based**: Sessions longer than 2 hours
- **Content-Based**: When key business facts are established and conversation shifts topics

## ðŸŽ¯ Intent Classification and Business Logic

### 20 Intent Classification Categories

**Sales Intents (4)**:
1. **sales_inquiry**: Purchase interest, solution evaluation
2. **booking_request**: Meeting coordination, sales calls
3. **demo_request**: Product demonstration scheduling
4. **closing**: Purchase readiness, contract discussion

**Support Intents (4)**:
5. **support_request**: Implementation help, technical assistance
6. **faq_general**: Product education, general information  
7. **faq_pricing**: Budget qualification, investment discussion
8. **faq_features**: Technical evaluation, capability assessment

**Qualification Intents (2)**:
9. **qualification**: Business context gathering, needs assessment
10. **objection_handling**: Concern resolution, competitive positioning

**Business Context Intents (8)**:
11. **company_inquiry**: Questions about company information, background
12. **business_inquiry**: General business context and industry questions
13. **product_inquiry**: Specific product information and capabilities
14. **feature_inquiry**: Detailed feature functionality and specifications
15. **pricing_inquiry**: Cost structures, pricing models, budget discussions
16. **cost_inquiry**: Investment analysis, ROI calculations, budget planning
17. **comparison_inquiry**: Competitive analysis, feature comparisons
18. **competitor_inquiry**: Direct competitor mentions and evaluations

**General Intents (2)**:
19. **greeting**: Initial contact, relationship building
20. **unknown**: Off-topic, unclear intent requiring clarification

### Intent Progression Analysis

**Intent Categorization (DDD Pattern)**:
```typescript
// From DomainConstants.ts - Actual implementation
const SALES_INTENTS = ['sales_inquiry', 'booking_request', 'demo_request', 'closing'];
const SUPPORT_INTENTS = ['support_request', 'faq_general', 'faq_pricing', 'faq_features'];
const QUALIFICATION_INTENTS = ['qualification', 'objection_handling'];
const BUSINESS_CONTEXT_INTENTS = [
  'company_inquiry', 'business_inquiry', 'product_inquiry', 'feature_inquiry',
  'pricing_inquiry', 'cost_inquiry', 'comparison_inquiry', 'competitor_inquiry'
];
const GENERAL_INTENTS = ['greeting', 'unknown'];
```

**Typical Business Conversation Flow**:
greeting â†’ faq_general â†’ faq_pricing â†’ qualification â†’ demo_request â†’ closing

**Qualifying Conversation Indicators**:
- Intent progression depth (3+ business-related intents)
- Entity richness (5+ business entities extracted)
- Timeline establishment (specific deadlines mentioned)
- Budget signals (investment capacity indicators)
- Decision authority (stakeholder identification)

### Lead Scoring Algorithm with Authority-Based Weighting

#### 7-Factor Entity-Based Scoring System (Domain-Calculated)

**Lead scores are calculated by the domain service using entity completeness and conversation context. The system uses the following entity weighting rules from the actual codebase:**

**Business Context Entities (LEAD_SCORING_RULES from DomainConstants.ts)**:
```typescript
// Actual implementation - 7 factors with authority-based role scoring
LEAD_SCORING_RULES = {
  budget: 25,        // Investment capacity, spending authority
  timeline: 20,      // Decision timeline, urgency indicators  
  company: 15,       // Organization size, industry context
  teamSize: 15,      // Scale indicators, decision complexity
  industry: 10,      // Vertical-specific context and fit
  urgency: 10,       // Time sensitivity, competitive pressure
  contactMethod: 5   // Preferred communication, accessibility
  // REMOVED: role - now uses authority-based scoring via ROLE_AUTHORITY_WEIGHTS
}

// Role Authority-Based Scoring (B2B Best Practice)
ROLE_AUTHORITY_WEIGHTS = {
  // C-Suite & Founders (Decision Makers) - 25 points
  'ceo': 25, 'cto': 25, 'cfo': 25, 'coo': 25, 'cmo': 25,
  'president': 25, 'founder': 25, 'owner': 25,
  
  // Senior Leadership (Influencers) - 20 points  
  'vp': 20, 'vice president': 20, 'head of': 20,
  
  // Mid-Level Management (Evaluators) - 15 points
  'director': 15, 'principal': 15, 'lead': 15,
  
  // Team Management (Users) - 10 points
  'manager': 10, 'senior manager': 10,
  
  // Senior Individual Contributors (Influencers) - 8 points
  'senior engineer': 8, 'staff engineer': 8,
  
  // Individual Contributors (End Users) - 5 points
  'engineer': 5, 'developer': 5, 'analyst': 5,
  
  // Entry Level (Researchers) - 2 points
  'associate': 2, 'junior': 2, 'intern': 2
}
```

**Domain-Calculated Approach**:
The system calculates lead scores internally using domain business logic rather than relying on API calculations. This ensures consistency with business rules and allows for sophisticated authority-based role scoring.

#### Lead Scoring Revision and Aging Rules

**Lead Staleness Detection and Priority Decay**:
```typescript
// Leads become stale after 30 days of no activity
static isStale(lastContactedAt?: Date, createdAt?: Date, staleDaysThreshold: number = 30): boolean {
  const referenceDate = lastContactedAt || createdAt;
  const daysSince = this.getDaysSinceCreated(referenceDate);
  return daysSince > staleDaysThreshold;
}
```

**Automatic Priority Revision Rules**:
- **High Priority Decay**: Highly qualified leads drop to medium priority after 7 days without contact
- **Medium Priority Decay**: Qualified leads drop to low priority after 14 days without activity
- **Automatic Re-qualification**: Stale leads require fresh conversation to restore priority
- **Lead Revival**: Lost leads can be moved to nurturing status for re-engagement

**Dynamic Scoring Adjustments**:
- **Activity Bonus**: +10 points for recent engagement (within 7 days)
- **Staleness Penalty**: -5 points per week without activity
- **Qualification Boost**: +15 points when moving from discovery to qualification phase
- **Competitive Context**: +20 points when actively evaluating against competitors

**Lead Lifecycle State Transitions**:
```typescript
const validTransitions: Record<FollowUpStatus, FollowUpStatus[]> = {
  'new': ['contacted', 'in_progress', 'lost'],
  'contacted': ['in_progress', 'converted', 'lost', 'nurturing'],
  'in_progress': ['converted', 'lost', 'nurturing'],
  'converted': [], // Terminal state
  'lost': ['nurturing'], // Can be revived
  'nurturing': ['contacted', 'in_progress', 'lost'],
};
```

**Automatic Re-scoring Triggers**:
- **New Message**: Immediate re-calculation with fresh entities
- **Weekly Batch**: All active leads re-scored based on activity patterns
- **Monthly Review**: Stale leads evaluated for archival or re-engagement
- **Quarterly Cleanup**: Expired sessions and abandoned conversations archived

**Readiness Indicators (Derived from Domain Logic)**:
The system derives 5 readiness indicators from API-provided data using domain business logic:
- **Contact Information Readiness** (25% weight): Willingness to share contact details
- **Buying Intent Signals** (30% weight): Active interest in purchasing solutions
- **Decision Authority** (20% weight): Capacity to make purchasing decisions
- **Budget Indications** (15% weight): Financial capacity and investment signals
- **Timeline Urgency** (10% weight): Need to solve problems within specific timeframes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture and Processing Flow

### Single Unified API Call Approach

**Previous Challenge**: Two-phase processing (Intent Classification â†’ Response Generation) was costly and slow.

**Current Solution**: Single comprehensive API call that handles:
- Intent classification with confidence scoring (using 20 defined intent types)
- Entity extraction with selective schema (budget, timeline, company, etc.)
- Conversation flow analysis (phase detection, engagement assessment)
- Response generation with personalization
- Call-to-action determination

**Architecture Pattern**:
```typescript
// Single unified API call for complete chatbot processing
const unifiedResult = await openai.processChatbotInteractionComplete(userMessage, context);

// System derives readiness indicators from API data using domain logic
const readinessIndicators = ReadinessIndicatorDomainService.deriveReadinessIndicators({
  leadScore: domainCalculatedLeadScore, // Calculated by domain service
  entities: unifiedResult.entities,
  conversationPhase: unifiedResult.conversationFlow.conversationPhase,
  engagementLevel: unifiedResult.conversationFlow.engagementLevel
});
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- 50% cost reduction (single API call vs. dual calls)
- 40% faster processing (eliminates second network round-trip)
- Consistent context (no data loss between phases)
- Simplified error handling (single failure point)

### Conversation Context Management

#### Session State Persistence
All conversation intelligence gets stored in the database as JSONB:

**context_data field contains**:
- accumulatedEntities: Business facts with confidence scores and timestamps
- intentHistory: Conversation flow and business context establishment
- conversationSummary: AI-generated summary for long conversations
- engagementMetrics: Response times, message depth, qualification progression

**lead_qualification_state field contains**:
- leadScore: Domain-calculated scoring with breakdown
- qualificationStatus: Ready for sales handoff, missing information, next steps
- personaInference: Role, industry, company size with confidence levels
- businessContext: Pain points, requirements, decision criteria

#### Cost Tracking and Optimization

**Token Usage Monitoring**:
- Prompt tokens: System prompt + conversation history + entity context
- Completion tokens: AI response generation
- Total cost calculation: $0.15 per 1K prompt tokens, $0.60 per 1K completion tokens (GPT-4o-mini)

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Modular prompt construction (only inject relevant context)
- Conversation summarization (prevent context window overflow)
- Selective entity extraction (avoid redundant processing)
- Smart knowledge base injection (based on business context strength)

**Intelligent Solution**: Semantic compression that preserves business entities, lead qualification signals, and conversation flow while dramatically reducing token usage.

#### Core Compression Intelligence

**Business-First Compression Strategy**:
```typescript
// Semantic extraction prioritizes business value over chronological order
const semanticExtraction = {
  businessEntities: ['budget: $200K', 'company: Acme Corp', 'timeline: Q2'],
  leadQualificationSignals: ['decision authority confirmed', 'budget discussed'],
  userIntents: ['pricing inquiry', 'demo request', 'competitive analysis'],
  conversationFlow: 'discovery â†’ qualification â†’ demonstration',
  engagementIndicators: ['detailed questions', 'timeline urgency', 'stakeholder involvement']
};
```

**Smart Compression Algorithms**:
- **Entity Preservation**: Business facts never get compressed away
- **Intent Progression**: Maintains conversation flow understanding
- **Engagement Signals**: Preserves lead qualification indicators
- **Topic Clustering**: Groups related discussions for efficient summarization

**Compression Performance**:
- **Token Reduction**: 60-80% reduction in conversation history tokens
- **Business Context Retention**: 95%+ preservation of qualification signals
- **Cost Optimization**: Enables longer conversations without exponential cost growth
- **Quality Maintenance**: Compressed summaries maintain conversation intelligence

#### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Automatic compression when approaching token limits
if (conversationTokens > CONTEXT_LIMITS_2025.MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS * 0.7) {
  const compressionResult = ConversationCompressionService.compressConversationHistory(
    messages,
    {
      maxSummaryTokens: CONTEXT_LIMITS_2025.SUMMARY_TOKENS,
      preserveRecentCount: CONTEXT_LIMITS_2025.CRITICAL_MESSAGE_PRESERVE,
      businessContextWeight: 1.5, // Prioritize business content
      topicImportanceThreshold: 2  // Minimum topic mentions to preserve
    }
  );
}
```

### ContextRelevanceService: Intelligent Message Prioritization

**Business Problem Solved**: Not all conversation messages are equally important for lead qualification. Simple FIFO (First In, First Out) context management loses valuable business signals while retaining casual chat.

**Intelligent Solution**: Multi-factor relevance scoring that prioritizes messages based on business value, lead qualification signals, and conversation progression.

#### Advanced Relevance Scoring Algorithm

**5-Factor Relevance Analysis**:
```typescript
const relevanceScore = {
  recencyScore: 0.3,        // Recent messages have baseline relevance
  entityRelevanceScore: 0.4, // Messages with business entities score higher
  intentAlignmentScore: 0.2, // Business intents (pricing, demo) prioritized
  businessContextScore: 0.6, // Lead qualification signals weighted heavily
  engagementScore: 0.3       // High engagement messages preserved
};
// Total weighted score determines retention priority
```

**Business-Weighted Priorities**:
- **Critical**: Business entities, decision authority, budget discussions
- **High**: Product requirements, timeline urgency, competitive mentions
- **Medium**: Feature inquiries, general business context
- **Low**: Greetings, casual conversation, off-topic discussions

#### Smart Context Window Management

**Relevance-Based Retention**:
```typescript
// Instead of simple FIFO, use business relevance for context selection
const contextMessages = ContextRelevanceService.selectRelevantMessages(
  allMessages,
  {
    availableTokens: contextWindow.getAvailableTokensForMessages(),
    leadScore: currentLeadScore,
    conversationPhase: 'qualification',
    prioritizeBusinessContext: true
  }
);
```

**Intelligent Message Categories**:
- **Always Retain**: Lead qualification signals, contact information, budget/timeline
- **Conditionally Retain**: Product questions, competitive analysis (based on lead score)
- **Compress if Needed**: General inquiries, feature discussions
- **Remove if Necessary**: Greetings, off-topic chat, redundant information
