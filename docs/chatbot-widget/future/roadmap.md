## 🎯 Success Definition

**MVP is successful when:**
1. Widget works on your WordPress company site
2. Visitors can have conversations with AI
3. Conversations result in captured leads
4. Admin can configure and manage the bot
5. System is stable and secure

**That's it. Everything else is future scope.**

## 🔄 After MVP Success

Once MVP proves the concept works:
1. **Validate**: Does it actually generate quality leads?
2. **Learn**: What features do users actually want?
3. **Decide**: Is this worth scaling into a business?
4. **Plan**: Beta phase based on real customer feedback

**Don't build Beta features until MVP succeeds.**
