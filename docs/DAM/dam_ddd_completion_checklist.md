# DAM DDD Migration Completion Checklist

## Overview
This checklist covers the remaining ~10% of work needed to complete the DDD migration for the DAM system. The core architecture is already excellent - these are refinements and completions.

**Current Status: ~90% Complete** 🎉

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: Server Actions DDD Migration

### 1.1 Migrate `text-asset.actions.ts` to Pure DDD
- [ ] Review current mixed patterns in `text-asset.actions.ts`
- [ ] Migrate `getAssetTextContent` to use `GetAssetContentUseCase`
- [ ] Migrate `updateAssetTextContent` to use `UpdateAssetTextUseCase`
- [ ] Migrate `createTextAsset` to use `CreateTextAssetUseCase`
- [ ] Remove direct Supabase calls from actions
- [ ] Ensure all text asset actions use the executor pattern
- [ ] Test text asset actions work correctly
- [ ] Update any components using these actions if needed

### 1.2 Review and Migrate `gallery.actions.ts`
- [ ] Audit `gallery.actions.ts` for DDD compliance
- [ ] Identify any direct database calls that should use use cases
- [ ] Migrate to use cases if needed
- [ ] Apply executor pattern consistently
- [ ] Test gallery functionality

### 1.3 Review and Migrate `tag.actions.ts`
- [ ] Audit `tag.actions.ts` for DDD compliance
- [ ] Ensure all tag operations use appropriate use cases:
  - [ ] `CreateTagUseCase`
  - [ ] `UpdateTagUseCase`
  - [ ] `DeleteTagUseCase`
  - [ ] `ListTagsUseCase`
- [ ] Apply executor pattern consistently
- [ ] Remove any direct Supabase calls
- [ ] Test tag functionality

### 1.4 Review `asset-url.actions.ts`
- [ ] Check if `asset-url.actions.ts` needs DDD migration
- [ ] Create use case if complex business logic exists
- [ ] Otherwise ensure it's properly structured

## 🧹 Phase 3: Legacy Cleanup & Refinement

### 3.1 Remove Direct API Calls
- [ ] Audit components for direct `/api/dam/` calls
- [ ] Ensure all components use server actions instead
- [ ] Remove any unused API routes if they exist
- [ ] Update documentation

### 3.2 Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Error Handling Standardization**
  - [ ] Ensure all use cases throw proper domain errors
  - [ ] Standardize error messages across the system
  - [ ] Add error logging where needed
- [ ] **Type Safety**
  - [ ] Review and strengthen TypeScript types
  - [ ] Ensure proper domain/DTO separation
  - [ ] Fix any `any` types

### 3.3 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Repository Query Optimization**
  - [ ] Review Supabase queries for efficiency
  - [ ] Add proper indexes if needed
  - [ ] Optimize search queries
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - [ ] Implement proper Next.js caching
  - [ ] Add revalidation tags where appropriate
  - [ ] Cache folder tree for better performance

## 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)

### 4.1 Domain Events (if needed)
- [ ] **Identify Events**
  - [ ] AssetUploaded
  - [ ] AssetDeleted
  - [ ] FolderCreated
  - [ ] TagAdded
- [ ] **Implement Event System**
  - [ ] Create domain event interfaces
  - [ ] Add event dispatching to entities
  - [ ] Create event handlers
- [ ] **Event Use Cases**
  - [ ] Audit logging
  - [ ] Notification triggers
  - [ ] Analytics events

### 4.2 Advanced Validation
- [ ] **Business Rule Validation**
  - [ ] File size limits per organization
  - [ ] File type restrictions
  - [ ] Storage quota enforcement
- [ ] **Data Consistency**
  - [ ] Orphaned file cleanup
  - [ ] Folder hierarchy validation
  - [ ] Tag consistency checks

### 4.3 Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Logging Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add structured logging to use cases
  - [ ] Track performance metrics
  - [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] **Health Checks**
  - [ ] Repository health checks
  - [ ] Storage service health checks
  - [ ] Database connection monitoring

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The DDD migration is complete when:

1. ✅ **All server actions use DDD patterns** (no direct DB calls)
2. ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage** (>80% for use cases)
3. ✅ **Clean dependency flow** (Components → Actions → Use Cases → Domain)
4. ✅ **Consistent error handling** throughout the system
5. ✅ **Performance requirements met** (search <500ms, uploads work smoothly)
6. ✅ **Documentation up to date** and accurate
