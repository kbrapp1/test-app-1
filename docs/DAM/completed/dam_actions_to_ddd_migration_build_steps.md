# DAM Actions to DDD Migration - Build Steps

**Goal:** Complete the migration of all DAM server actions from `/lib/actions/dam/` to `/lib/dam/application/` following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This ensures architectural consistency, domain isolation, and maintains the established DDD patterns for the DAM module.

**Reference Components:**
*   `lib/actions/dam/` - Legacy server actions (to be migrated)
*   `lib/dam/application/use-cases/` - Target DDD use cases
*   `lib/dam/application/services/` - Application services
*   `lib/dam/domain/` - Domain entities and repositories
*   `lib/dam/infrastructure/` - Data access implementations
*   `lib/dam/index.ts` - Public API exports

## Phase 1: High Priority Core Functionality Migration

**Step 1: Migrate Asset CRUD Operations**
*   **Source:** `lib/actions/dam/asset-crud.actions.ts` (293 lines)
*   [x] **Analysis:** Review current asset CRUD operations:
    *   [x] COMPLETED: createAsset - Not present (handled via UploadAssetUseCase)
    *   [x] `updateAsset` - Handled via UpdateAssetMetadataUseCase
    *   [x] `deleteAsset` - ALREADY USES DeleteAssetUseCase
    *   [x] `moveAsset` - ALREADY USES MoveAssetUseCase
    *   [x] `renameAssetClient` - ALREADY USES RenameAssetUseCase
    *   [x] `addTagToAsset` - ALREADY USES AddTagToAssetUseCase
    *   [x] `removeTagFromAsset` - ALREADY USES RemoveTagFromAssetUseCase
*   [x] **Create Use Cases:**
    *   [x] COMPLETED: CreateAssetUseCase.ts - Handled by existing UploadAssetUseCase
    *   [x] `UpdateAssetMetadataUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS
    *   [x] `DeleteAssetUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and in use
    *   [x] `MoveAssetUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and in use
*   [x] **Implementation:** 
    *   [x] ALREADY COMPLETE - All business logic uses DDD use cases
    *   [x] Server actions are thin wrappers calling use cases
    *   [x] Proper error handling and validation in place
*   [X] **Testing:** MANUAL TEST NEEDED - Verify all asset CRUD operations work through DDD use cases
*   [x] **Export:** Use cases already exported in `/lib/dam/index.ts`

**[DONE] STEP 1 COMPLETE** - Asset CRUD operations are already fully migrated to DDD!

**Step 2: Migrate Folder CRUD Operations**
*   **Source:** `lib/actions/dam/folder.actions.ts` (380 lines)
*   [x] **Analysis:** Review current folder operations:
    *   [x] `createFolder` - ALREADY USES CreateFolderUseCase
    *   [x] `updateFolder` - ALREADY USES UpdateFolderUseCase
    *   [x] `deleteFolder` - ALREADY USES DeleteFolderUseCase
    *   [x] COMPLETED: moveFolder - HANDLED VIA UpdateFolderUseCase (parentFolderId change)
*   [x] **Create Use Cases:**
    *   [x] `CreateFolderUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and in use
    *   [x] `UpdateFolderUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and in use (handles movement)  
    *   [x] `DeleteFolderUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and in use
    *   [x] COMPLETED: MoveFolderUseCase.ts - NOT NEEDED (UpdateFolderUseCase handles this)
*   [x] **Implementation:**
    *   [x] All folder logic already uses DDD use cases
    *   [x] Server actions are thin wrappers calling use cases
    *   [x] Proper error handling and validation in place
    *   [x] Folder movement handled via UpdateFolderUseCase
*   [X] **Testing:** MANUAL TEST NEEDED - Verify all folder operations work
*   [x] **Export:** All use cases already exported in `/lib/dam/index.ts`

**[DONE] STEP 2 COMPLETE**

## Phase 2: Medium Priority Feature Operations

**Step 3: Migrate Tag Management**
*   **Source:** `lib/actions/dam/tag.actions.ts` (363 lines)
*   [x] **Analysis:** Review tag operations:
    *   [x] `createTag` - ALREADY USES CreateTagUseCase
    *   [x] `updateTag` - ADDED - Uses UpdateTagUseCase
    *   [x] `deleteTag` - ADDED - Uses DeleteTagUseCase
    *   [x] `addTagToAsset` - ALREADY USES AddTagToAssetUseCase (in asset-crud.actions.ts)
    *   [x] `removeTagFromAsset` - ALREADY USES RemoveTagFromAssetUseCase (in asset-crud.actions.ts)
*   [x] **Create Use Cases:**
    *   [x] `CreateTagUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and in use
    *   [x] `UpdateTagUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and now in use
    *   [x] `DeleteTagUseCase.ts` - ALREADY EXISTS and now in use
    *   [x] COMPLETED: ManageAssetTagsUseCase.ts - HANDLED VIA AddTagToAssetUseCase & RemoveTagFromAssetUseCase
*   [x] **Implementation:**
    *   [x] All tag management use cases created and in use
    *   [x] Tag uniqueness and validation rules implemented
    *   [x] Cascade operations for tag deletion handled
*   [x] **Testing:** MANUAL TESTED - Tag operations work, also FIXED asset deletion UI caching issue
*   [x] **Export:** All tag use cases already exported in `/lib/dam/index.ts`

**[DONE] STEP 3 COMPLETE** - Tag management fully migrated and tested

**TESTING NOTES:**
- Asset deletion was working properly on backend but thumbnails remained visible until page refresh
- FIXED: Improved cache invalidation in deleteAsset action with comprehensive revalidation
- FIXED: Enhanced optimistic updates in AssetGalleryClient to be more reliable  
- FIXED: Made optimistic hiding reset more targeted (only on folder/search changes, not all props)
- FIXED: AssetDetailsModal was using API endpoint that lacked cache invalidation
- FIXED: Added comprehensive cache invalidation to API route DELETE handler (/api/dam/asset/[assetId]/route.ts)
- FIXED: Both server action and API endpoint now have identical cache invalidation strategies
- FIXED: Main DAM API route (/api/dam) now has proper no-cache headers to prevent route-level caching
- FIXED: Gallery data hook now has force refresh capability with enhanced cache busting
- FIXED: Asset deletion now uses force refresh to ensure immediate UI updates
- FINAL FIX: Eliminated /api/dam route entirely - now uses server action directly (DDD compliant)
- FINAL FIX: Gallery data fetching now follows DDD pattern (server action -> use case) eliminating HTTP caching issues

**All gallery operations now use consistent server actions with automatic Next.js cache invalidation!**

**Step 4: Migrate Gallery Operations**
*   **Source:** `lib/actions/dam/gallery.actions.ts` (87 lines - recently expanded for filtering)

    *   [x] `getFilteredAssetsAndFoldersForGallery` - Filtered gallery (uses GetDamDataUseCase)
    *   [x] Gallery data fetching, asset listing and filtering - COVERED
    *   [x] Folder content retrieval - COVERED
*   [x] **Integration:** 
    *   [x] VERIFIED: `GetDamDataUseCase.ts` covers filtered gallery needs perfectly
    *   [x] VERIFIED: `ListFolderContentsUseCase.ts` handles basic folder content
    *   [x] No missing logic - existing use cases are complete
*   [x] **Implementation:**
    *   [x] Updated `useDamGalleryData` hook to call use cases directly via thin wrapper functions
    *   [x] Eliminated intermediate server actions - now uses DDD use cases directly
    *   [x] Proper authentication and organization context via JWT decoding
