1. **Clean Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns across presentation, application, and domain layers
2. **Type Safety:** Complete TypeScript integration with domain entities
3. **Maintainability:** Elimination of code duplication and legacy patterns
4. **Performance:** Optimized component structure and state management
5. **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage in domain layer

### Migration Scope
- **Legacy Components:** 50+ components in `components/dam/` directory
- **Target Architecture:** Domain-driven structure in `lib/dam/presentation/`
- **Functionality Preservation:** Zero breaking changes to existing features
- **Code Quality:** Improved organization and reduced complexity
