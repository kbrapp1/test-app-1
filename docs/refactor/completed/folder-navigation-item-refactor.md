# FolderNavigationItem Refactoring - Golden Rule Compliance

## Overview
Refactored `FolderNavigationItem.tsx` to comply with the golden rule (200-250 lines max) and DDD Single Responsibility Principle.

## Problem
- **Original file**: 254 lines (exceeded golden rule by 4 lines)
- **Multiple responsibilities**: API fetching, state management, UI rendering, dialog management
- **Mixed concerns**: Business logic mixed with presentation

## Solution
Applied DDD Single Responsibility Principle by extracting specialized components and services:

### 1. FolderTreeFetcher Service (39 lines)
**Responsibility**: API calls and data transformation
- Handles folder tree API requests
- Validates response data
- Provides error handling for API failures

### 2. useFolderNavigation Hook (75 lines)
**Responsibility**: State management and business logic
- Manages dialog states (rename, delete)
- Handles folder expand/collapse logic
- Coordinates with folder store
- Provides error handling with toast notifications

### 3. FolderExpandButton Component (42 lines)
**Responsibility**: Expand/collapse button display and interaction
- Renders appropriate icon based on folder state (loading, error, expanded)
- Handles button click events
- Manages disabled state during loading

### 4. FolderLink Component (35 lines)
**Responsibility**: Folder link display and navigation
- Renders folder icon and name
- Handles navigation to folder
- Shows drop indicator during drag operations

### 5. FolderActionsMenu Component (47 lines)
**Responsibility**: Dropdown menu and actions
- Renders actions dropdown menu
- Handles rename and delete action triggers
- Manages menu visibility based on hover/active state

### 6. Simplified FolderNavigationItem (145 lines)
**Responsibility**: Folder item coordination only
- Coordinates between extracted components
- Manages drop zone functionality
- Handles recursive rendering of child folders
- Manages dialog mounting/unmounting

## Results
- **Reduced from 254 lines to 145 lines** (43% reduction)
- **Golden rule compliant**: Well within 200-250 line limit
- **Enhanced maintainability**: Each component has a single, clear responsibility
- **Improved testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Better reusability**: Services and hooks can be reused across components
- **No breaking changes**: Maintained public API

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component/service has one clear purpose
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Domain logic, state management, and presentation are separated
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested
4. **Improved Reusability**: Services and hooks can be shared across components
5. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in the hook
6. **Cleaner Code**: Reduced complexity in the main component
