## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Generation failed with provider error"
- **Cause**: Temporary AI provider service interruption
- **Solution**: Wait 30 seconds and retry generation
- **Prevention**: Use alternative provider if available

**Issue**: "Audio URL not accessible"  
- **Cause**: Generated audio URL has expired (common with Replicate)
- **Solution**: Click "Mark as Problematic" button, then regenerate
- **Prevention**: Save important audio to DAM immediately after generation

**Issue**: "Text exceeds character limit"
- **Cause**: Input text over 5,000 character limit
- **Solution**: Break content into smaller segments or edit to reduce length
- **Prevention**: Use character counter to monitor input length

**Issue**: "Voice not found for selected provider"
- **Cause**: Invalid voice ID or provider mismatch
- **Solution**: Select voice from dropdown or verify voice ID format
- **Prevention**: Use voice selector instead of manual ID entry

**Issue**: "Permission denied accessing TTS feature"
- **Cause**: Organization TTS feature disabled or user lacks permissions
- **Solution**: Contact administrator to enable TTS feature
- **Prevention**: Verify organizational feature flags before accessing

### Performance Optimization

**Slow Generation Times**
- Try alternative provider (ElevenLabs typically faster for short content)
- Break large text into smaller segments
- Avoid special characters that may require additional processing

**Audio Quality Issues**
- Experiment with different voices for your content type
- Check text formatting (remove extra spaces, special characters)
- Use ElevenLabs for higher quality output when budget allows

**Interface Responsiveness**
- Clear browser cache if interface becomes sluggish
- Disable browser extensions that may interfere with audio playback
- Use Chrome or Firefox for optimal compatibility

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: What types of content work best with TTS?**
A: Clear, well-formatted text without excessive special characters. Marketing copy, training materials, and documentation perform excellently. Avoid text with complex formatting or non-standard punctuation.

**Q: How long does generation typically take?**
A: ElevenLabs: 3-10 seconds for most content. Replicate: 30-120 seconds depending on text length and system load.

**Q: Can I use the same voice across multiple generations?**
A: Yes, voice selections are preserved in your session. For consistency across projects, document your preferred voice IDs.

**Q: Is there a cost per generation?**
A: Costs depend on your organization's AI provider subscriptions. Contact your administrator for usage guidelines and any applicable quotas.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What audio formats are supported?**
A: Generated audio is provided in web-optimized formats (typically MP3 or WAV) suitable for both streaming and download.

**Q: Can I integrate TTS audio into other applications?**
A: Yes, generated audio URLs can be embedded in other systems. Consider saving important audio to DAM for permanent accessibility.

**Q: How long are audio URLs valid?**
A: ElevenLabs URLs are permanent. Replicate URLs may expire after 24-48 hours. Save important audio to DAM for long-term storage.

**Q: Can I batch process multiple texts?**
A: Currently, each generation is processed individually. Use the history panel to manage multiple generations efficiently.

### Administrative Questions

**Q: How do I enable TTS for my organization?**
A: Organization administrators can enable TTS through the feature flags system. Contact your platform administrator for assistance.

**Q: Can I control which providers my team can access?**
A: Yes, provider access can be configured at the organization level through feature flag settings.

**Q: Is usage tracked and reported?**
A: Yes, comprehensive usage analytics are available through the administrative interface, including generation counts, provider usage, and cost tracking.

**Q: How is sensitive content protected?**
A: All content is encrypted in transit and at rest. Multi-tenant architecture ensures complete data isolation between organizations.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: What should I do if generation consistently fails?**
A: Check your internet connection, try alternative providers, and contact support if issues persist across multiple providers.

**Q: Can I recover lost audio if I forgot to save to DAM?**
A: Check the generation history panel - recent generations remain accessible. However, save important audio to DAM immediately for permanent storage.

**Q: Why can't I hear generated audio?**
A: Verify browser audio permissions, check volume settings, and ensure your browser supports the audio format. Try refreshing the page if issues persist.

**Q: How do I report audio quality issues?**
A: Use the feedback mechanism in the interface or contact your organization's platform administrator with specific examples of quality concerns.
