# DDD-Compliant Image Generator Polling Refactor Plan

**Objective**: Eliminate 90% network redundancy by applying Golden Rule DDD architecture principles
**Current Issue**: 5 overlapping polling systems for 1 generation causing 36/40 redundant calls
**Target**: Single unified polling system with <10% redundancy rate

---

## 🏗️ DDD Architecture Analysis

### Current Architecture Violations

**❌ Single Responsibility Principle**: Multiple services doing the same job
- `useGenerationPolling` + `useBatchGenerationPolling` + `useGenerations` all polling same data
- `GenerationStatusService.checkGenerationStatus` + `checkMultipleGenerationStatus` duplicate logic

**❌ Network Efficiency**: Not minimizing redundant calls
- Same Supabase queries executed 5 different ways
- Same Replicate API calls from different entry points
- No request deduplication or caching strategy

**❌ Layer Separation**: Presentation directly managing infrastructure concerns
- React hooks directly calling multiple server actions
- No proper DTO boundaries between layers
- Infrastructure polling logic mixed with presentation state

## 🎯 DDD-Compliant Solution Design

### Domain Layer (Pure Business Logic)

#### 1. **Generation Status Domain Service** 
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/domain/services/GenerationStatusDomainService.ts
// Single Responsibility: Business rules for generation status management
// No external dependencies, pure domain logic
```

**Responsibilities**:
- [ ] Define business rules for status transitions
- [ ] Determine when polling is needed vs cached data
- [ ] Calculate polling intervals based on generation age
- [ ] Business logic for batch vs individual status checks

#### 2. **Generation Polling Specification**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/domain/specifications/GenerationPollingSpecification.ts
// Business rules for when and how to poll generations
```

**Responsibilities**:
- [ ] Encapsulate "needs polling" business rules
- [ ] Define terminal vs active status logic
- [ ] Polling frequency business rules

### Application Layer (Use Case Orchestration)

#### 3. **Unified Status Management Use Case**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/application/use-cases/ManageGenerationStatusUseCase.ts
// Single Responsibility: Orchestrate all status checking needs
// Coordinates domain objects, no business logic
```

**Responsibilities**:
- [ ] Single entry point for ALL status checking needs
- [ ] Coordinate between repository, provider, and domain services
- [ ] Handle DTO mapping between layers
- [ ] Implement request deduplication at application level

#### 4. **Status Management Application Service**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/application/services/StatusManagementService.ts
// Coordinates status use case with proper caching and batching
```

**Responsibilities**:
- [ ] Request deduplication and batching logic
- [ ] Cache management for status responses
- [ ] Coordinate multiple generation status checks efficiently

#### 5. **Status Management DTOs**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/application/dto/StatusDto.ts
// Data contracts between layers
```

**DTOs Needed**:
- [ ] `GenerationStatusDto` - Clean status data for presentation
- [ ] `StatusCheckRequestDto` - Standardized request format
- [ ] `BatchStatusResponseDto` - Efficient batch response format

### Infrastructure Layer (External Concerns)

#### 6. **Unified Provider Status Service**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/infrastructure/providers/UnifiedProviderStatusService.ts
// Single point for all external provider status checks
```

**Responsibilities**:
- [ ] Request deduplication for external API calls
- [ ] Provider-agnostic status checking
- [ ] Rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] Cache external provider responses

#### 7. **Optimized Repository Implementation**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/infrastructure/persistence/supabase/OptimizedGenerationRepository.ts
// Efficient database queries with proper caching
```

**Optimizations**:
- [ ] Batch database queries instead of individual calls
- [ ] Implement proper query caching
- [ ] Use database-level filtering for active generations
- [ ] Minimize data transfer with targeted selects

### Presentation Layer (UI Coordination)

#### 8. **Unified Status Hook**
```typescript
// lib/image-generator/presentation/hooks/useUnifiedGenerationStatus.ts
// Single React Query hook for ALL status needs
```

**Responsibilities**:
- [ ] Single source of truth for generation status
- [ ] Proper React Query configuration with deduplication
- [ ] Provide data to all components that need status
- [ ] Handle loading states and error boundaries
