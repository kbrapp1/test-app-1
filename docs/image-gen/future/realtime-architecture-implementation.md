# Image Generator Real-Time Architecture - Implementation Plan

**CURRENT STATUS:** Polling-Based System âœ… | Webhook Infrastructure Ready ðŸ”¥ | Target: Zero-Polling Event-Driven Architecture

**ARCHITECTURE TRANSFORMATION:**
âœ… **Current State:** Frontend polling â†’ Provider APIs â†’ Database updates â†’ UI refresh cycles
ðŸŽ¯ **Target State:** Provider webhooks â†’ Job queues â†’ Background workers â†’ Real-time notifications â†’ Instant UI updates

**MAJOR TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS REQUIRED:**
âœ… **Event-Driven Architecture:** Domain events, webhook handlers, job queues, background workers
âœ… **Golden Rule Compliance:** All components under 250 lines with single responsibility
âœ… **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket/SSE connections with automatic fallback
âœ… **Webhook Integration:** Direct provider notifications (Replicate, OpenAI future-ready)
âœ… **Scalable Job Processing:** Redis-based queues with worker scaling
âœ… **Zero-Polling System:** Eliminate all frontend and backend polling

**IMMEDIATE GOALS:**
1. ðŸ”¥ **Create job queue infrastructure** with Redis and BullMQ
2. ðŸ”¥ **Implement webhook endpoints** for provider notifications  
3. ðŸ”¥ **Build real-time notification system** with WebSocket/SSE
4. ðŸ”¥ **Update domain layer** with event-driven patterns
5. ðŸ”¥ **Migrate presentation layer** to real-time updates
6. ðŸ”¥ **Deploy with zero-downtime** migration strategy

**Goal:** Transform the image generation system from polling-based to event-driven architecture, achieving instant status updates, 95% reduction in API costs, and horizontal scalability while maintaining DDD principles and golden-rule compliance.

**Reference Architecture:**
- **Domain Layer:** `lib/image-generator/domain/` - Events, enhanced entities, event publisher
- **Application Layer:** `lib/image-generator/application/` - Webhook handlers, notification use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer:** `lib/image-generator/infrastructure/` - Job queues, webhook providers, real-time services
- **Presentation Layer:** `lib/image-generator/presentation/` - Real-time hooks, WebSocket components

**Target Benefits:**
- Zero polling API calls to providers
- Sub-second status update delivery
- 99.9% webhook delivery success rate
- Support for 1000+ concurrent connections
- 95% reduction in provider API costs
- Horizontal scalability with distributed processing

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- ðŸ”¥ **DDD Event Patterns:** Domain entities must publish events, application layer handles side effects
- ðŸ”¥ **Golden Rule Compliance:** Every component under 250 lines with single responsibility
- ðŸ”¥ **Graceful Degradation:** Automatic fallback to polling if real-time systems fail
- ðŸ”¥ **Zero Downtime:** Dual-mode operation during migration, gradual rollout strategy

**Technology Stack:**
- **Job Queue:** Redis + BullMQ for scalable background processing
- **Real-Time:** Supabase Realtime (primary), WebSocket fallback for advanced features
- **Webhooks:** Provider-specific endpoints with signature validation
- **Events:** In-memory event bus with Supabase real-time persistence
