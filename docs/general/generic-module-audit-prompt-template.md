## üîç Generic Module Audit Prompt

```
I need you to perform a comprehensive audit of the {MODULE_NAME} module against Golden Rule DDD guidelines, architectural best practices, and performance optimization opportunities.

**MODULE TO AUDIT:** lib/{module-name}/
**FOCUS AREAS:** DDD layer adherence, performance optimization, code quality, Golden Rule compliance

**AUDIT REQUIREMENTS:**

### 1. DDD Layer Architecture Compliance
**Check for violations:**
- [ ] Domain layer importing from infrastructure/application/presentation
- [ ] Application layer importing from infrastructure/presentation  
- [ ] Infrastructure layer importing from presentation
- [ ] Cross-domain imports (importing from other module infrastructures)
- [ ] Missing abstractions/interfaces in application layer
- [ ] Business logic in wrong layers

**Validate layer structure:**
- [ ] Domain: entities, value-objects, repositories (interfaces), services, events
- [ ] Application: use-cases, services, dto, actions, commands, queries, mappers
- [ ] Infrastructure: persistence, providers, storage, external integrations
- [ ] Presentation: components, hooks, types (UI-specific)

### 2. Golden Rule Compliance Check
**File Size & Responsibility:**
- [ ] Any files over 200-250 lines (require refactoring)
- [ ] Components with multiple responsibilities
- [ ] Single responsibility principle violations
- [ ] DRY principle violations (duplicate code patterns)

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Missing error handling patterns
- [ ] Outdated patterns or deprecated code

- [ ] Memory leak patterns in hooks/components

**Bundle Size:**

### 4. Architecture & Integration Issues
**Service Integration:**
- [ ] Direct infrastructure dependencies in use cases
- [ ] Missing dependency injection patterns
- [ ] Tight coupling between layers
- [ ] Hard-coded external service calls

**Data Flow:**
- [ ] DTOs not used at layer boundaries
- [ ] Domain entities exposed to presentation

- [ ] Missing data transformation patterns

### 5. Testing & Quality Assurance
**Test Coverage:**

- [ ] No integration tests for use cases
- [ ] Missing error scenario testing
- [ ] Performance regression test gaps

**Code Organization:**
- [ ] Unclear naming conventions
- [ ] Missing documentation for complex logic
- [ ] Inconsistent patterns across similar components
- [ ] Architectural decision documentation

### 6. Security & Privacy Review
**Security & Privacy:**
- [ ] Proper input validation and DTO schema enforcement
- [ ] No hard-coded secrets; use environment variables for sensitive config
- [ ] Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest where applicable
- [ ] Access control and authorization boundaries enforced
- [ ] Compliance considerations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and data protection measures

**DELIVERABLES REQUESTED:**

### Audit Report Format:
1. **Critical Violations** (üö® Priority 1 - Breaks Architecture; Must fix before next release (<24h))
   - List specific DDD layer violations with file paths
   - Identify cross-domain imports and tight coupling
   - Note any fundamental architectural breaks

2. **High-Impact Performance Issues** (üî• Priority 2 - Major Performance Impact; Address in next sprint)
   - React Query optimization opportunities
   - Component performance bottlenecks
   - Network and caching inefficiencies
   - Memory management issues

3. **Code Quality Issues** (‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 3 - Code Quality & Maintainability; Plan for next 1-2 sprints)
   - File size violations (>250 lines)
   - Single responsibility violations
   - Missing error handling
   - Code duplication patterns

4. **Optimization Opportunities** (‚ö° Priority 4 - Performance Enhancements; Backlog as future improvements)
   - Bundle size reduction opportunities
   - Advanced performance features
   - Developer experience improvements

### Specific Analysis for Each Layer:

**Domain Layer Analysis:**
- Check all imports - should have ZERO external dependencies
- Validate entities are pure business logic
- Ensure repository interfaces (not implementations)
- Check value objects are immutable
- Verify domain services contain only business rules

**Application Layer Analysis:**
- Check for direct infrastructure imports
- Validate use cases orchestrate domain objects only
- Ensure DTOs are used for external boundaries
- Check for proper dependency injection patterns
- Validate command/query separation

**Infrastructure Layer Analysis:**
- Check repository implementations
- Validate external service integrations
- Check database-specific logic isolation
- Ensure proper error handling for external calls
- Validate configuration management

**Presentation Layer Analysis:**
- Check React Query usage and configuration
- Validate component performance patterns
- Check hook organization and responsibilities
- Ensure proper error boundaries
- Validate responsive design patterns
- Verify accessibility compliance (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast, semantic HTML)

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
- Provide specific file paths for each violation
- Include severity assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Estimate performance impact percentages where possible
- Suggest specific refactoring approaches
- Maintain backward compatibility in recommendations

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Please structure your response as:
1. Executive Summary (compliance score, major issues)
2. Critical Violations (immediate fixes needed)
3. Performance Optimization Opportunities (with impact estimates)
4. Refactoring Recommendations (prioritized action items)
5. Implementation Roadmap (suggested order of fixes)

Focus on actionable insights that maintain DDD principles while improving performance and code quality.

## üìã Module-Specific Customization Template

### Quick Customization for Any Module:

**Step 1: Replace Placeholders**
```bash
# Replace {MODULE_NAME} with actual module name (e.g., "DAM", "Text-to-Speech", "Campaign Management")
# Replace {module-name} with kebab-case path (e.g., "dam", "text-to-speech", "campaign-management")
```

**Step 2: Add Module-Specific Context**
```
**MODULE CONTEXT:**
- Primary domain purpose: [Brief description of what this module does]
- Key entities: [List main business entities]
- External integrations: [APIs, services, databases it connects to]
- UI complexity: [Simple forms, complex dashboards, real-time updates, etc.]
- Performance requirements: [Real-time, batch processing, large datasets, etc.]
```

**Step 3: Focus Areas (Optional Customization)**
```
**ADDITIONAL FOCUS AREAS FOR {MODULE_NAME}:**
- [ ] [Module-specific architectural patterns]
- [ ] [Domain-specific performance concerns]
- [ ] [Integration-specific issues]
- [ ] [UI/UX specific optimizations]
```
