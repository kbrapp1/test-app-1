# Functional Specification Document: Digital Asset Management (DAM)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional requirements for the Digital Asset Management (DAM) system within this application. The goal is to provide a comprehensive system to upload, organize, discover, and manage digital assets (images, videos, documents), built incrementally through planned phases. A key objective throughout development is to deliver a modern, highly interactive, and performant user experience ('FANG-like' quality).

## 2. Goals

*   Implement a robust system for managing digital assets.
*   Allow users to easily upload, view, organize, search, and manage various asset types.
*   Support team collaboration through permissions and versioning.
*   Achieve a high standard of User Experience (UX) characterized by responsiveness, smooth transitions, and intuitive design.
*   Provide a scalable foundation for potential future enhancements.

## 3. User Roles

*   **User:** Any authenticated user of the application. (Specific permissions and roles may be defined in later phases).

## 4. Functional Requirements

*(Note: Requirements are grouped by planned implementation phase for clarity)*

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
*   **[x] FR-DAM-001:** The system shall provide an intuitive interface, including a clear button and a drag-and-drop area, for users to select one or more image files from their local device.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-002:** The system shall restrict uploads to specific image file types (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP) via client-side validation with immediate feedback.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-003:** The system shall store uploaded images in a designated Supabase Storage bucket.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-004:** The system shall record basic metadata for each uploaded asset in a Supabase database table (filename, size, type, path, user ID, timestamp).
*   **[x] FR-DAM-005:** The system shall provide clear, non-intrusive user feedback upon successful upload or failure (e.g., toast notification).
*   **[x] FR-DAM-006:** The system shall display uploaded images in a responsive gallery format (e.g., grid of thumbnails).
*   **[x] FR-DAM-007:** The gallery shall fetch asset information efficiently from the database and storage.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-008:** Users shall be able to easily select an image from the gallery view for deletion (e.g., hover effect with delete icon).
*   **[x] FR-DAM-009:** The system shall prompt the user for confirmation before deleting an asset.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-010:** Upon confirmation, the system shall delete the corresponding image file from Supabase Storage.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-011:** Upon confirmation, the system shall delete the corresponding metadata record from the Supabase database.
*   **[x] FR-DAM-012:** The gallery view shall update immediately and smoothly after deletion (e.g., via `revalidatePath`).
*   **[x] FR-DAM-013:** The system shall provide clear user feedback upon successful deletion or failure.

### Phase 2: Core Organization & Management
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-014:** The system shall provide UI functionality for users to create hierarchical folders.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-015:** The system shall allow users to move assets between folders.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-016:** The system shall provide UI functionality for users to add and remove tags to/from assets.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-017:** The system shall support multi-selecting assets within the gallery view (e.g., via checkboxes).
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-018:** The system shall allow users to perform bulk deletion on selected assets, with appropriate confirmation.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-019:** The database schema shall be updated to support folders (e.g., `folder_id` on `assets` table) and tags (e.g., `tags` and `asset_tags` tables).

### Phase 3: Enhanced Discovery & Asset Types
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-020:** The system shall provide a search interface allowing users to find assets based on criteria such as filename and tags.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-021:** The system shall allow users to sort assets in the gallery view (e.g., by name, date uploaded, size).
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-022:** The system shall allow users to filter assets in the gallery view (e.g., by tag, potentially by folder).
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-023:** The system shall extend upload validation and handling to support common video file types.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-024:** The system shall extend upload validation and handling to support common document file types (e.g., PDF).
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-025:** The system shall display appropriate thumbnails or icons for non-image file types in the gallery view.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-026:** The asset preview mechanism shall be updated to handle video playback and document viewing (potentially leveraging browser capabilities or libraries).

### Phase 4: Collaboration & Control
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-027:** The system shall allow definition of user roles or permissions related to DAM access (e.g., view, upload, manage).
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-028:** System actions (e.g., view, delete, move) shall enforce defined user permissions.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-029:** The UI shall adapt based on user permissions (e.g., hiding management controls for view-only users).
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-030:** The system shall track changes to assets, enabling version history.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-031:** The system shall provide a UI for users to view the version history of an asset.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-032:** The system shall allow users with appropriate permissions to revert an asset to a previous version.

### Phase 5: Advanced Capabilities
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-033:** The system shall provide basic image editing capabilities (e.g., cropping, resizing) via the UI.
*   **[ ] FR-DAM-034:** The system shall define how edited assets are saved (e.g., overwrite, new version, new asset).
*   **[ ] *(Placeholder)* FR-DAM-035:** The system may allow generating shareable links for assets.
*   **[ ] *(Placeholder)* FR-DAM-036:** The system may support adding comments or annotations to assets.
*   **[ ] *(Placeholder)* FR-DAM-037:** The system may provide basic analytics on asset usage.
*   **[ ] *(Placeholder)* FR-DAM-038:** The system may integrate AI for automatic tagging of uploaded images.

## 5. User Interface (UI) Considerations (High-Level)

*   **Consistency:** UI components should remain consistent with the established `shadcn/ui` style guide.
*   **Responsiveness:** All views (uploader, gallery, previews) must be fully responsive across common screen sizes.
*   **Feedback:** Clear visual feedback (loading states, progress indicators, success/error messages) is required for all user interactions.
*   **Smoothness:** Transitions, animations, and updates should feel smooth and avoid jarring page reloads where possible.
*   **Accessibility:** UI elements should follow accessibility best practices.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-DAM-001:** Uploads should be performant, with minimal UI blocking and clear progress indication.
*   **NFR-DAM-002:** Asset retrieval and gallery rendering should be highly efficient, especially when handling large numbers of assets.
*   **NFR-DAM-003:** Storage costs should be considered (potential limits on file size or total storage per user may be needed).
*   **NFR-DAM-004:** All interactions (drag-drop, clicks, previews, deletions, searches, filtering) should feel smooth and responsive.
*   **NFR-DAM-005:** The system should maintain data integrity between the database and storage.
*   **NFR-DAM-006:** Security best practices must be followed for file handling, storage access, and authorization.

## 7. Phased Implementation Note

The functional requirements listed above are grouped by planned implementation phase. This allows for iterative development and delivery of value.

## 8. Assumptions

*   Users are already authenticated via the existing Supabase auth setup.
*   Basic Supabase project setup (database, storage) is complete.
*   Styling will use the existing Tailwind CSS setup and `shadcn/ui` components.
