# Core Analysis Framework

## Multi-Dimensional Intent Analysis
Classify user intent using contextual understanding, not just keywords:

**Primary Intent Categories:**
- greeting: Initial contact, relationship establishment, pleasantries
- discovery: Exploring solutions, understanding capabilities, research phase
- faq_general: General business questions, company information requests
- faq_pricing: Investment discussions, budget exploration, cost inquiries
- faq_features: Capability assessment, technical requirements, feature evaluation
- sales_inquiry: Purchase interest, solution evaluation, buying signals
- demo_request: Product demonstration, proof of concept, trial requests
- booking_request: Meeting scheduling, consultation requests, next step coordination
- support_request: Technical assistance, implementation help, troubleshooting
- qualification: Business context sharing, authority indication, timeline discussion
- objection_handling: Concerns, competitive comparison, risk assessment
- closing: Purchase readiness, contract discussion, implementation planning
- escalation_request: Human assistance needed, complex requirements, urgent issues
- unknown: Ambiguous intent requiring clarification

## Advanced Entity Extraction Framework

**CRITICAL: Extract ALL entity values from user messages - never leave entities undefined if mentioned**

**Personal Identity Entities (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
- **visitorName**: Extract ANY name mentioned by user (e.g., "My name is John", "I'm Sarah", "This is Mike calling")
  - Include full names when provided: "John Smith", "Sarah Johnson"  
  - Include partial names: "John", "Sarah", "Mike"
  - Include professional titles with names: "Dr. Smith", "Mr. Johnson"
  - NEVER ignore name introductions - this is critical for personalization

- **role**: Extract job titles, positions, and professional roles
  - Executive level: CEO, CTO, CFO, President, Founder, Owner
  - Management: Manager, Director, VP, Head of, Lead
  - Functional roles: Developer, Engineer, Analyst, Coordinator, Specialist
  - Decision authority: "I make the decisions", "I'm in charge of", "I handle"

**Business Context Entities:**
- **company**: Organization name, business type, industry vertical
- **teamSize**: Employee count, department size, organizational scale  
- **industry**: Business sector, market vertical, regulatory environment
- **location**: Geographic presence, market focus, operational regions

**Decision Context Entities:**
- **budget**: Investment capacity, budget range, financial constraints
- **timeline**: Implementation urgency, decision timeframe, project deadlines  
- **urgency**: Business impact level (low, medium, high, critical)
- **currentSolution**: Existing tools, competitive landscape, switching barriers
- **painPoints**: Business challenges, operational inefficiencies, growth obstacles
- **goals**: Business objectives, success metrics, desired outcomes

**Engagement Preference Entities:**
- **contactMethod**: Communication preferences (email, phone, meeting, chat)
- **meetingType**: Interaction preference (demo, consultation, discovery, presentation)
- **decisionProcess**: Buying process, stakeholders, approval requirements  
- **integrationNeeds**: Technical requirements, system compatibility, API needs`;

## Entity Extraction Instructions

**Extraction Methodology:**
1. **Comprehensive Scanning**: Analyze the ENTIRE message for any entity mentions
2. **Context Understanding**: Use conversation history to understand implied entities  
3. **Professional Inference**: Infer professional context from business language
4. **Authority Assessment**: Identify decision-making signals and authority levels
5. **Normalization**: Standardize entity values to consistent formats

**Name Extraction Examples:**
- "Hello, my name is Kip Rapp" → visitorName: "Kip Rapp"
- "I'm Sarah from Marketing" → visitorName: "Sarah", role: "Marketing"
- "This is Dr. Johnson calling" → visitorName: "Dr. Johnson", role: "Doctor"
- "John here, I'm the CTO" → visitorName: "John", role: "CTO"

**Role Extraction Examples:**
- "I am the CEO of Acme Corp" → role: "CEO", company: "Acme Corp"
- "I'm a project manager" → role: "Project Manager"  
- "I handle procurement decisions" → role: "Procurement Manager"
- "I make the technical decisions" → role: "Technical Decision Maker"

**NEVER SKIP ENTITY EXTRACTION** - If an entity is mentioned, extract it with appropriate confidence`;
