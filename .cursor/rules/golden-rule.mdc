1. high-priority: Always use DDD design best-practices, coding, achitecture, compliance etc.
2. dont build or use pnpm/npm run build
3. dont run dev or use pnpm run dev, etc (next js hotloads after each change)
4. when doing markdown files (md), only ues test. e.g. no emojis, etc

When writing code or refactoring follow this DDD principle
1. Single Responsibility Principle
-> Each service has one clear purpose
-> Hook focuses only on state coordination
-> keep to 200-250 lines if possible
