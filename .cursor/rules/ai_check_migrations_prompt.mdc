-   **User Prompt Keyword:** `@migrations`
-   **Schema Dump Override:** If the user provides a full schema dump file (e.g., `docs/supabase/full_schema_dump.sql`), treat that file as the primary source of truth for the database schema, RLS policies, triggers, functions, and all DDL/DCL detailsâ€”unless the user directs otherwise.
-   **Default Behavior:** If no schema dump is provided, prioritize examining the contents of the `supabase/migrations/` directory.
-   **AI Action When Keyword is Detected:**
    -   When the user includes `@migrations` in their prompt, or when schema understanding is required, follow this precedence:
        1. If a schema dump file is provided and up-to-date, use it as the source of truth.
        2. Otherwise, use the SQL files within the `supabase/migrations/` directory as the most up-to-date definition.
    -   Treat the selected source as authoritative for:
        -   Database schema (tables, columns, data types, constraints, relationships).
        -   Row Level Security (RLS) policies (`CREATE POLICY`, `ALTER POLICY`).
        -   Database functions (`CREATE FUNCTION`).
        -   Database triggers (`CREATE TRIGGER`).
        -   Views (`CREATE VIEW`).
        -   Enabled extensions (`CREATE EXTENSION`).
        -   Any other Data Definition Language (DDL) or Data Control Language (DCL) statements.
    -   This context is crucial for accurately answering questions or making suggestions related to the Supabase database structure, security logic, data access patterns, or potential migration issues.
    -   If the user references specific migration files by name or timestamp after using `@migrations`, focus on those files but also consider the cumulative effect of all migrations for complete context if the query is broad.
    -   If neither the schema dump nor the `supabase/migrations` folder contents are readily available in the current context, use available tools (like `list_dir` or `read_file` on specific migration files if their names are known or can be inferred) to gather this information.

**Note:** Always clarify with the user if there is any ambiguity about which file or folder is the most current or authoritative source for the database schema.
