Always follow these core development principles when writing code: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), DDD (Domain-Driven Design), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It). These principles should guide all code decisions and architecture choices.
