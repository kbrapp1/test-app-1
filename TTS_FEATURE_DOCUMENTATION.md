## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Audio Generation Failures

**Issue**: "Speech generation failed" error message
**Symptoms**: Generation starts but fails with error after processing
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Text Length**: Ensure text is within supported character limits (typically 1000-5000 characters)
2. **Verify Voice Selection**: Confirm selected voice is available for chosen provider
3. **Review Text Content**: Remove special characters or formatting that may cause issues
4. **Try Alternative Provider**: Switch between Replicate and ElevenLabs providers
5. **Contact Support**: If issue persists, contact technical support with error details

**Prevention**:
- Use text validation before submission
- Test with shorter content first
- Keep backup of original text content

#### Permission and Access Issues

**Issue**: "Insufficient permissions" or "Feature not available" messages
**Symptoms**: Cannot access TTS interface or specific features are disabled
**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Organization Access**: Confirm your organization has TTS feature enabled
2. **Check User Role**: Ensure your role includes necessary TTS permissions
3. **Contact Administrator**: Request role upgrade from organization administrator
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies, then log in again
5. **Session Refresh**: Log out and log back in to refresh permissions

**Prevention**:
- Regularly review user permissions with administrators
- Understand role-based access limitations
- Maintain current browser and clear cache regularly

#### Audio Playback Problems

**Issue**: Generated audio won't play or has poor quality
**Symptoms**: Player shows error, audio is distorted, or no sound output
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Browser Settings**: Ensure browser allows audio playback and media permissions
2. **Test Different Browser**: Try accessing TTS in different web browser
3. **Update Audio Drivers**: Ensure computer audio drivers are current
4. **Check Network Connection**: Verify stable internet connection for audio streaming
5. **Download and Test**: Download audio file and test in external media player

**Prevention**:
- Use supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Keep browser and system updated
- Test audio setup with other applications

#### History and Asset Management Issues

**Issue**: Generated audio not appearing in history or DAM system
**Symptoms**: Recent generations missing from history panel or asset library
**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh Interface**: Use browser refresh or click refresh button in history panel
2. **Check Filters**: Verify no search filters are hiding relevant content
3. **Verify Save Action**: Confirm "Save to DAM" action was completed successfully
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have permission to view history and assets
5. **Wait for Sync**: Allow time for system synchronization (typically 1-2 minutes)

**Prevention**:
- Explicitly save important generations to DAM
- Use descriptive names for saved assets
- Regularly backup important content

### Performance Optimization

#### Slow Generation Times

**Issue**: Speech generation takes longer than expected
**Expected Time**: Most generations complete within 30-90 seconds
**Optimization Steps**:
1. **Reduce Text Length**: Break long content into smaller segments
2. **Choose Optimal Provider**: Test different providers for speed comparison
3. **Off-Peak Usage**: Use during lower traffic periods when possible
4. **Network Optimization**: Ensure stable, high-speed internet connection

#### Interface Loading Issues

**Issue**: TTS interface loads slowly or incompletely
**Optimization Steps**:

## 10. FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is the Text-to-Speech feature and how does it work?**
A: The TTS feature converts written text into natural-sounding spoken audio using advanced AI technology. You simply enter your text, select a voice, and the system generates professional-quality audio that you can play, download, or save to your organization's asset library.

**Q: Who can use the TTS feature?**
A: Access depends on your organization's settings and your user role. Most organizations enable TTS for all users, but specific capabilities (like generating speech, saving to assets, or viewing history) depend on your assigned role (Viewer, Member, Editor, or Admin).

**Q: Is there a cost for using TTS?**
A: TTS usage costs are managed at the organization level. Individual users typically don't see per-use charges, but organizations may have usage limits or cost controls in place. Contact your administrator for specific details about your organization's TTS policy.

**Q: What languages and voices are supported?**
A: The system supports multiple languages and accents including American English, British English, and various international options. Available voices include both male and female options across different providers. The specific selection may vary based on your organization's provider configuration.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What text formats are supported?**
A: The system accepts plain text input with standard punctuation. It automatically optimizes text for speech generation, handling paragraph breaks, punctuation, and common formatting. Very long texts may need to be divided into smaller segments for optimal results.

**Q: How long does it take to generate audio?**
A: Generation time varies based on text length and provider, but most requests complete within 30-90 seconds. Shorter texts (under 500 characters) typically generate in 15-30 seconds, while longer content may take up to 2-3 minutes.

**Q: What audio formats are provided?**
A: Generated audio is provided in high-quality formats suitable for most applications. The specific format depends on the AI provider but typically includes MP3 or WAV files that work with standard audio players and applications.

**Q: Can I edit or modify generated audio?**
A: The TTS system generates final audio files that cannot be directly edited within the platform. However, you can regenerate audio with modified text or different voice selections. For advanced audio editing, you can download files and use external audio editing software.

### Usage and Workflow Questions

**Q: How do I save generated audio for later use?**
A: You can save generated audio to your organization's Digital Asset Management (DAM) system by clicking "Save to Library" after generation. This makes the audio searchable and accessible to other team members based on your organization's sharing permissions.

**Q: Can I reuse previous generations?**
A: Yes, the History panel (clock icon) shows all your previous generations. You can replay audio, reload the text into the input form for modification, or save previously generated audio that wasn't initially saved to the DAM system.

**Q: How do I share generated audio with team members?**
A: Audio saved to the DAM system can be shared with team members according to your organization's permission settings. You can also download audio files and share them through other communication channels or include them in presentations and documents.

**Q: Can I generate audio from existing documents?**
A: Yes, you can load text from existing assets in your DAM system by clicking "Load from Library." This allows you to convert previously saved documents, scripts, or other text content into audio format.

### Quality and Customization Questions

**Q: How do I choose the best voice for my content?**
A: Voice selection depends on your content type and audience. Consider:
- **Gender**: Choose male or female based on brand guidelines or content appropriateness
- **Accent**: Select American, British, or other accents based on target audience
- **Provider**: Test different providers (Replicate, ElevenLabs) for quality preferences
- **Content Type**: Formal content may benefit from certain voice characteristics

**Q: Can I adjust speech speed or tone?**
A: Basic voice characteristics are determined by the selected voice and provider. Some providers offer limited customization options. For more control over speech characteristics, try different voice options or consider regenerating with modified text that includes natural pacing cues.

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the generated audio quality?**
A: Try these approaches:
- **Different Voice**: Test alternative voices or providers
- **Text Modification**: Adjust punctuation or phrasing for better flow
- **Shorter Segments**: Break long text into smaller, more manageable pieces
- **Provider Comparison**: Compare results between available AI providers
